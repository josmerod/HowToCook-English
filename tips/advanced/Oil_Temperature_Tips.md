# Oil Temperature Judgment Tips and Common Temperature Conversion Table

* **Oil temperature between 120°C-140°C**: Suitable for soft frying[^1], slippery stir-frying[^2]. Put chopsticks into the oil pot, there are basically no bubbles around, no green smoke, no sound, and the oil temperature is calm.
* **Oil temperature between 150°C-160°C**: Best cooking temperature. Put chopsticks into the oil pot, a few oil bubbles will appear around, slightly green smoke, and the oil moves from the surroundings to the center.
* **Oil temperature between 160°C-180°C**: Suitable for frying until crispy and coloring. Put chopsticks into the oil pot, a lot of green smoke rises, and the oil surface is relatively calm.
* (Note) It is best to buy an oil temperature gun, use a thermometer with caution.

> The so-called "X0% oil temperature" (several tenths) in online video tutorials refers to relative to 100% oil temperature, which is 300°C.
> That is, n tenths oil temperature T_n = 30n [degree Celsius]
> Temperature conversion formula
> C = 5/9 *(F - 32)
> Or
> F = 9/5*C + 32

* ^1: Soft frying is a frying method where small pieces, slices, or strips of materials are coated with paste, put into the oil pot, and fried until 70-80% cooked.
* ^2: Slippery stir-frying (Hua Chao) creates a smooth texture. Select tender animal raw materials, cut them into shreds, slices, cubes, strips, etc., coat with egg white and starch, slide them apart in warm oil, and pour into a colander to drain excess oil.
