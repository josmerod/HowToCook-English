# Stir-frying Sugar Color (Tang Se)

Principle: Sugar melts at high temperatures and assumes different properties after heating for different times.

Taking stir-frying 200ml sugar color as an example:

## Water Stir-frying

1. Take a pot with a **curved bottom** or a **flat bottom area less than 1/3**.
2. Add 8g of rock sugar, white granulated sugar, or soft white sugar to the pot. Rock sugar is better. If you want the sugar color to be sweeter, you can add about 2g more.
3. Add 50ml of 70°C hot water to the pot.
4. Place the pot on the stove.
5. If using a gas stove, adjust the fire from high to small to the minimum, so that the flame range does not exceed the water surface area. If using an induction cooker, turn it to the minimum and be ready to turn off the power at all times.
6. Use a spatula to constantly stir the sugar-water mixture. If it is rock sugar, you can use the back or edge of the spatula to gently tap it until it is crushed to accelerate melting. In this process, if the sugar has not melted but has started to change color, you need to continue adding hot water up to 50ml.
7. After the sugar is completely melted, the sugar-water mixture presents a viscous state and the color is transparent and whitish, like mica color. At this time, continue stirring.
8. Continue to stir the sugar-water mixture, the color of the mixture gradually turns white.
9. Continue to stir the sugar-water mixture, the color of the mixture starts to appear light brown.
10. Continue to stir the sugar-water mixture, the brown color of the mixture is very obvious.
11. Continue to stir the sugar-water mixture, the color of the mixture is brown and dense bubbles appear.
12. Continue to stir the sugar-water mixture, the color of the mixture is brown with dense bubbles, and larger bubbles appear in the dense small bubbles.
13. Add 150ml of 70°C hot water to the pot. At this time, the liquid in the pot presents a dark reddish-brown color, transparent and clear, with a faint smell of caramel.
14. Pour into a bowl to obtain 200ml of sugar color.

> [!Note]
> Supplement to Step 13:
> It is not recommended to use cold water instead of 70°C hot water because low temperature will cause the sugar to solidify and stick to the pot.

## Oil Stir-frying (Recommended)

1. Same as water stir-frying.
2. Same as water stir-frying.
3. Add 10ml of room temperature cooking oil to the pot.
4. Same as water stir-frying, the sugar-water mixture changes to a sugar-oil mixture. Finally, add 190ml of hot water. The rest is omitted.

## Appendix: Syrup States and Use Description

| State | Preparation Method | Use (Example) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Incompletely Melted Syrup | Water (Oil) Stir-frying Step 8 | Frosting Hawthorn |
| Completely Melted Syrup | Water (Oil) Stir-frying Step 9 | Candied Haws (Tanghulu) |
| Caramel | Naturally cooled after Water (Oil) Stir-frying Step 11 | Caramel |
| Sugar Color (Tang Se) | Water (Oil) Stir-frying Step 13 | Sugar Color |

* When using sugar color to cook food with small unit volume such as Braised Pork Belly, you can directly add ingredients before step 13 and quickly stir-fry until there is no obvious liquid accumulation at the bottom of the pot, then add water. This allows for faster coloring.
