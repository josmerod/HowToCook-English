# Auxiliary Ingredients Tips

* The order of adding auxiliary ingredients is basically as follows: first add ginger, then add scallions and garlic, chili, then add dry spices (star anise/Sichuan peppercorns/numbing peppers), and then add dried chili. Each step above can remove unnecessary auxiliary ingredients from the queue according to the different dishes being made.
* Ginger has the highest water content, which means we need more time to sauté the juice out of the ginger.
* If you use scallion sections (it is best to pat the scallion sections twice with a kitchen knife), then I recommend that you put the scallion sections in first, then the minced garlic. If you use chopped green onions (scallion flowers), you can put these two ingredients into the pot together. Note: The juice in scallion sections is more difficult to fry out.
* If you are making a stir-fry, then I recommend that you put the dry spices in before adding the ginger. This can make the oil more flavorful, so that the fried dish is more fragrant. The reason why stewed and braised dishes do not do this is because you may need to stir-fry many auxiliary ingredients, and the frying time of auxiliary ingredients is too long, causing the dry spices to turn black and bitter.
* Putting dried chili at the end is because dried chili easily turns black due to the temperature of the pot. Dried chili only needs to be stirred for a few seconds.
* Note: No matter what cuisine you like to cook, frying these auxiliary ingredients until golden brown over low heat can make the whole dish more fragrant, which seasonings cannot give.

## Timing of Adding Salt and Salt Control

* For quick stir-fry dishes, add salt first. Salt amount = total weight of ingredients x 0.9%;
* For meat dishes, add salt when 80% cooked. Salt amount = (total weight of ingredients + 30mL juice) x (1~1.2%);
* For soup dishes, add salt at the very end. Salt amount = initial water amount x 0.8%.
* The total daily salt intake is recommended not to exceed 5g, refer to [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/salt-reduction).
