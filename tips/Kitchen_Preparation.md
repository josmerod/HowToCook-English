## Choosing Oil

Before buying oil, you need to understand some basic knowledge about fatty acids.

### Classification of Fatty Acids

Fatty acids are classified into:

* Saturated fatty acids (Avoid as much as possible)
* Unsaturated fatty acids
  * Cis-fatty acids
  * Trans-fatty acids (Especially avoid)
  * Polyunsaturated fatty acids
  * Monounsaturated fatty acids

Saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature.

### Fatty Acids to Avoid

Among them, **saturated fatty acids** and **trans-fatty acids** are generally considered unhealthy.

Saturated fatty acids increase the risk of obesity, high cholesterol, and heart disease.

Studies have shown that long-term excessive consumption of trans-fatty acids produced by hydrogenation processing can cause abnormalities in human blood lipid metabolism, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Some studies also show it may increase the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.

The World Health Organization suggests: To improve cardiovascular health, the intake of trans-fatty acids should be controlled, with a maximum intake of not more than 1% of total energy. That is to say, if calculated based on an average daily energy intake of 2000 kcal for an adult, the daily intake of trans-fatty acids should not exceed 2.2 grams.

GB 28050-2011 stipulates that when food ingredients contain or use hydrogenated and/or partially hydrogenated oils/fats during production, the content of trans-fatty acids must also be indicated in the nutrition facts table.

### Trans-fatty Acids in Food

According to relevant surveys, the average content of trans-fatty acids in baked goods (cakes, biscuits, bread, etc.), condiments, and fried foods is between 0.30~0.50 g/100g.

Therefore, don't worry too much—trans-fatty acids in daily food are not enough to harm health. But just in case, when buying snacks, you might as well pay attention to the `Trans Fat` content labeled in the nutrition facts table.

### Trans-fatty Acids in Cooking

According to a 2021 survey, the average content of trans-fatty acids in vegetable oils in China is 0.86 g/100g, so there is no need to worry too much.

The source of trans-fatty acids that requires extra attention is the cooking process:

Vegetable oils often contain a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have relatively poor thermal stability and are easily converted into trans fats at high temperatures.

Therefore, in different scenarios, we need to choose oil products reasonably and minimize the heating time of oil products as much as possible.

### Selection of Vegetable Oils

| Oil Name | Saturated Fatty Acid (%) | Omega 3 (%) | Omega 6 (%) | Omega 9 (%) |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Canola Oil | 7% | 11% | 21% | 61% |
| Flaxseed Oil | 9% | 57% | 16% | 18% |
| Sunflower Oil | 12% | 1% | 71% | 16% |
| Corn Oil | 13% | 1% | 57% | 29% |
| Olive Oil | 15% | 1% | 9% | 75% |
| Soybean Oil | 15% | 8% | 54% | 23% |
| Peanut Oil | 19% | 0% | 33% | 48% |
| Cottonseed Oil | 27% | 0% | 54% | 19% |
| Lard | 43% | 1% | 9% | 47% |
| Palm Oil | 51% | 0% | 10% | 39% |
| Tallow (Beef Fat) | 68% | 1% | 3% | 28% |
| Coconut Oil | 91% | 0% | 2% | 7% |

* `Peanut Oil`: Rich in `monounsaturated fat`. But only recommended to choose high quality. When processing, also pay attention not to heat for too long to avoid producing `trans-fatty acids`.
* `Olive Oil`: Rich in `monounsaturated fat`, it has only one unsaturated bond. Olive oil has low `saturated fatty acid` content. But only recommended to choose high quality. Pay attention not to heat too long.
* `Soybean Oil`: Does not contain `saturated fatty acid`, and contains linoleic acid and vitamins. But soybean oil is unstable and easily produces `trans-fatty acids` during processing, so it is not recommended for long-term consumption. Can be used for cold dressing.
* `Rapeseed Oil (Canola)`: Good thermal stability, rich in `polyunsaturated fatty acids`, but may contain erucic acid, which may cause fat deposition and heart damage. Rapeseed oil lacks linoleic acid, has lower nutritional value, and easily spoils.
* `Coconut Oil`: Very high in `saturated fatty acid`, good thermal stability, but note that some foods use hydrogenated coconut oil. Suitable for frying in spirits, frequent consumption increases obesity risk.
* `Palm Oil`: Very high in `saturated fatty acid`, good thermal stability, frequent consumption increases high cholesterol risk.
* `Lard`, `Tallow`, and other animal fats: Rich in `saturated fatty acid`, frequent consumption increases high cholesterol risk. Not recommended for long-term consumption.

Therefore, according to the table above, we can draw some conclusions:

* No oil is perfect; each has its pros and cons. We should choose different oils for different cooking scenarios.
* Do not always use the same type of oil; rotate them to ensure nutritional balance.
* To avoid ingesting too much `trans-fatty acid`: When heating, do not choose thermally unstable oils, and do not heat for too long.
* Do not consume large amounts of fried foods. Oils with good thermal stability often contain large amounts of `saturated fatty acids` and are not suitable for long-term consumption.
* Do not reuse oil. Oil generates large amounts of `trans-fatty acids` during the heating process.
* Do not eat takeout for long periods, as it is difficult to determine what oil they used.

#### Stir-fry Oil

* Peanut Oil (High Quality)
* Olive Oil (High Quality)
* Canola Oil (Low Erucic Acid)

Peanut oil, olive oil, and canola oil contain more unsaturated fatty acids and less saturated fatty acids. However, their thermal stability is relatively poor, and they easily produce trans-fatty acids during heating. Therefore, pay attention to controlling the heating time.

#### Frying Oil

* Coconut Oil
* Palm Oil
* Tallow
* Lard

When stir-frying at high heat or deep-frying, use oils with better thermal stability, such as coconut oil, palm oil, or tallow. They produce fewer trans-fatty acids. However, their saturated fatty acid content is higher, so they are not suitable for long-term consumption.

#### Cold Dressing and Stewing Oil

* Flaxseed Oil
* Sesame Oil
* Walnut Oil
* Perilla Oil

These scenarios do not require heating, so no trans-fatty acids will be produced. Do not choose oils with too much saturated fatty acid.
