# Steaming (Rice) / Stewing (Using Electric Rice Cooker/Pressure Cooker/Electric Pressure Cooker)

## What is a Pressure Cooker?

A pressure cooker is actually a normal pot plus a lockable semi-sealed lid with a valve on the lid used to control the pressure inside the pot.

### Working Principle

The working principle of a pressure cooker is to let steam accumulate in the pot to increase the pressure inside the pot. When the pressure inside the pot increases, the boiling point of water also increases, allowing the cooking temperature of water-containing food to exceed 100°C.

### Advantages

* Since the actual cooking temperature of the pressure cooker is higher, the cooking time can be significantly shortened.
* The high temperature inside the pressure cooker can promote browning and caramelization, capable of producing unique flavors.

## Process

* Put ingredients and water into the inner pot, close the lid, **ensure the pot body is sealed**, and heat.
* For tough ingredients, such as tendons, using a pressure cooker can easily cook them until soft and obtain a good texture.
* Pressure cookers usually have a self-locking valve (float valve). During steaming, as the pressure inside the pot increases, the self-locking valve will start and lock, isolating the gas inside the pot from the outside, creating conditions for pressurizing the pot. After the self-locking valve starts, it will also lock the lid to prevent forcible opening, acting as a safety guarantee. During steaming, confirm that the self-locking valve is not blocked by foreign objects so the pressure cooker works normally.
* After switching to the heat preservation state, **open the lid only after emptying the steam in the pot through the exhaust valve**.

### Precautions

* **Steam is very hot, do not get close to the exhaust valve.**
* During the cooking of **liquid food**, **do not manually exhaust**, be careful of spraying (you can put ingredients in a sealed jar or vacuum packaging bag and then cook in a pressure cooker).
* Manually releasing gas when cooking some cuisines (such as soups) **may affect the taste and texture of the food**.
* Confirm steam is emptied before opening the lid. Do not open fully at once, especially **do not open the lid facing people**, to avoid steam burns.
* After cooking is completed, as the air pressure in the pressure cooker drops to balance with the outside air pressure, the self-locking valve will loosen. This can be used as a sign of whether the lid can be opened.
* The sealing of the pressure cooker depends on the sealing rubber ring in the lid. For old pressure cookers, check if the sealing rubber ring is still effective.
* Confirm the rubber ring is completely clean; any particles stuck in it may destroy the sealed environment.
* Many pressure cookers have a safety line; materials and liquids should not exceed this line. Too many ingredients and liquids may cause water vapor to block the exhaust valve, or splash too much water vapor which is hard to clean.
* For pressure cookers without a safety line, it is best not to let the water level exceed 2/3 of the pot body.
* **Do not use a pressure cooker to cook foods that easily produce foam, such as oats or noodles**. Foam may block the steam valve and pressure relief pipe.
* During cooking, when the pressure valve rises and sprays steam or smoke, it means the interior of the pressure cooker is over-pressurized, and the pressure valve releases excess pressure to ensure safety. Although the sprayed steam brings a rich aroma and high pleasure, first, the flavor of the food is lost, and second, excessive pressurization may bend the card slot of some types of pressure fryers. Therefore, when you see steam spraying, you can reduce the heat.
* Tip: Opening the lid from the side is a good choice.
