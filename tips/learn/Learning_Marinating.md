# Marinating (Meat)

## Note

The marinating described here is a preparatory step before cooking ingredients, not making finished products like salted meat or sausages.

## Marinating

Marinating meat before cooking is a common method to let flavors penetrate beforehand. Generally, the object of marinating is raw meat. According to the needs of the dish, you can determine the size of the meat cut yourself.

  For example, for popcorn chicken, chicken breast is cut into dice-sized pieces and then put into a bowl to marinate.
  
  For example, for roast whole lamb, lamb leg, half or whole lamb does not need to be cut; apply a large specific amount of seasoning on the surface to marinate.

Depending on the dish, the seasonings and auxiliary ingredients selected for marinating can be of any kind. Sometimes for different tastes, auxiliary ingredients may also need to be pre-processed.

## Basic Concepts of Marinating

Described here is the marinating process for normal tastes.

- Generally, the larger the amount of meat (e.g., marinating 5kg of chicken wings at once), the larger the volume (e.g., a whole leg of lamb), and the heavier the taste, the more seasonings and auxiliary ingredients are needed.
- Generally, the longer the planned marinating time, the fewer seasonings and auxiliary ingredients are used.
- When marinating, the ingredients should be evenly covered on all surfaces. If it is meat slices or shreds, use your hands to grab and mix as evenly as possible. If it is a whole leg of lamb, use your hands or a brush to brush evenly on the surface.
- Generally, stir-fried meat and fried meat need to be marinated in advance. Stir-fried meat should ensure the fresh and tender texture of the meat, and cooking often requires high heat and short time. When short-time cooking makes it difficult for flavors to penetrate, marinating in advance can make up for the lack of flavor.

## Marinating Techniques

- **Thin meat shreds/slices**: Since the meat quality is fragile, be as gentle as possible. Shape your fingers like a claw machine claw and gently grab and mix the marinade. Then stir gently in one direction.
- **Meat shreds, slices, chunks**: Same technique as above, but force can be slightly greater.
- **Chicken legs, wings, etc.**: First verify a few knife cuts on the ingredients. Chicken drumsticks and legs can be pierced with a knife. Then mix the marinade in a bowl first, then put the ingredients into the bowl and coat evenly.
- **Lamb legs, etc.**: Generally, you can pierce holes in thick parts of the meat. Then mix the marinade well and apply evenly to the surface.

## Marinating Containers and Time

- Choose a container that can hold the ingredients and marinade. Including bowls, plates, trays, etc. This is **open marinating**, generally for a short time, commonly 0.5-2 hours. (Roasted) lamb legs etc. can also be marinated like this, but for a longer time.
- You can choose a large enough food sealing bag for marinating. This is **sealed marinating**, generally for a very long time, such as overnight, or for ribs that are difficult to flavor. Commonly 4 hours to overnight. At this time, use slightly less material to prevent the finished dish from tasting too heavy or salty.

## Common Marinating Ingredients

- **Light Soy Sauce**: Provides sauce aroma and salty base taste. Can be used for almost all meats.
- **Dark Soy Sauce**: Saltiness is not strong, but easy to color. Used for adjusting base color and enhancing aroma. Generally should not be used in large quantities to prevent bean smell. Can be used for almost all red meats (less common), pork liver, etc., can involve more.
- **Salt**: Salty but does not have sauce aroma after stir-frying. Can be used for all meats.
- **White Sugar**: Adjusts sweetness (large amount), can also add fresh and tender texture to meat (small amount). Can be used for all poultry and livestock meats, but not commonly used for fish and seafood.
- **Brown Sugar**: Adjusts sweetness and unique taste of brown sugar, taste is slightly heavier than white sugar. Can be used for almost all meats (generally darker meat or finished dish color is deeper).
- **Oyster Sauce**: Increases umami, salty, and sweet tastes. Generally used for red meat.
- **White Vinegar / Rice Vinegar**: Adds sour taste. Less used.
- **Mature Vinegar / Balsamic Vinegar**: Not only adds sour taste but also enhances aroma and color. Balsamic vinegar is suitable for dark fish (especially grilled fish).
- **Cooking Wine**: Removes fishy/gamy smell and enhances aroma. Can be used for almost all meats. But note:
  - Cooking wine itself has a strong taste, which easily masks the aroma of the ingredients themselves. For ingredients with a not strong fishy smell, consider not using cooking wine. Example: Beef, fish, and chicken.
  - For chicken, white liquor can be used instead of cooking wine.
  - For beef, ginger-scallion water can be used instead of cooking wine.
  - For white fish meat, just wash away blood streaks and mucous membranes, and there will be no fishy smell. It is recommended not to add cooking wine.
- **Yellow Wine (Huangjiu)**: Removes fishy smell and enhances aroma, better effect than cooking wine, aroma is more complex. Generally used for white meat. Red meat can also use it, but effect is comparable to cooking wine.
- **Five-spice Powder / Thirteen-spice**: Adds fragrance to meat, simplest compound spice. Five-spice powder merely adds fragrance; Thirteen-spice has a unique, recognizable fragrance. Use these controlled amounts. Can be used for almost all meats, but less common for fish and seafood.
- **Chili Powder**: Many kinds. Aside from type, divided by fineness into powder/flakes etc. Besides adding spiciness, it colors the dish. Avoid excessive chili. Can be used for almost all meats requiring spicy base, but cooking time should be controlled to prevent chili from becoming bitter or dark.
- **Cumin Powder / Fennel Powder**: Generally use ground powder as marinade, not granules, for easier absorption. Can be used for almost all red meat and chicken.
- **X Pepper Powder**: Adds pungent, spicy, fragrant tastes. Use in moderation.
  - **Black Pepper Powder**: Pungent, spicy. For almost all red meat.
  - **White Pepper Powder**: Pungent, fragrant. Slightly weaker than black pepper, highlights fragrance. For almost all meats.
  - **Sichuan Pepper Powder**: Pungent, numbing. Unique aroma. For almost all meats.
- **Bean Paste (Doubanjiang)**: Adds fermented bean aroma, saltiness, spiciness. For almost all red meats.
- **Scallion, Ginger, Garlic**: Scallion/Ginger remove smell; Garlic adds pungent aroma. Scallion cut into sections/slices; Ginger slices (peel if needed); Garlic slices/minced. If you don't want them in the finished dish, squeeze juice from them into a small amount of water to make ginger-scallion water for marinating. Garlic generally not added directly. For all meats.
- **Seafood Sauce / Shrimp Paste**: Adds umami/saltiness. Seafood sauce is sweet; Shrimp paste is heavy. For almost all meats, but not common.
- **Fermented Black Beans (Douchi)**: Adds fermented bean aroma/saltiness. For red meats, often used.
- **Starch (Shengfen)**: Important for "sizing" (shang jiang). Thicker sizing or smoother texture needs more starch. For almost all meats. `Starch can be used as simple frying coating (usually with flour), generally not added during marinating phase.`
  - Corn starch / Potato starch: High viscosity.
  - Sweet potato starch: Slightly lower viscosity.
- **Oil**: Add oil during marinating to "oil seal", locking moisture and flavor. If marinating in open container for long time, oil seal prevents drying. For almost all meats. Reduce base oil when stir-frying if oil sealed. No difference for deep frying.

## Several Common Marinating Formulas

- **Beef**: Moderate light soy sauce, small amount cooking wine, small amount white sugar. Salt (supplement saltiness), oyster sauce/hoisin sauce (minimal), five-spice/thirteen-spice (onion beef). Use scallion/ginger with caution.
- **Chicken (Breast/Wings)**: Moderate light soy sauce, less white sugar, small amount cooking wine. Salt, five-spice/thirteen-spice (popcorn chicken), very small dark soy sauce (pan-fried wings).
- **White Fish**: Moderate salt, small amount cooking wine/yellow wine. Seafood sauce/Steamed fish soy sauce (pan-fried ribbonfish), scallion/ginger water (roast fish with skin).
- **Red Fish**: Moderate light soy sauce, small amount cooking wine. Seafood soy sauce/Steamed fish soy sauce (pan-fried salmon), brown sugar (Nordic roast salmon).
- **Pork Liver**: Moderate light soy sauce, moderate cooking wine. Starch, moderate dark soy sauce (stir-fried liver), small amount sugar.
