# Cold Dishes (Liangban)

## What is Liangban?

Liangban is a way of mixing main ingredients with auxiliary ingredients by stirring to form a dish.

### Forms of Liangban

Liangban can be made into a form where ingredients and auxiliary ingredients are mixed in space.
Liangban can be made into a form where ingredients and auxiliary ingredients are separated in space. In this case, the auxiliary ingredients are called dipping sauces.

### Why Liangban?

* Some cold dishes do not require a heat source when served.
* Some cold dishes can reduce the process of washing the pot (no washing or just rinsing with water).
* Cold dishes can preserve the state of ingredients, especially shown in vegetables and raw meat.

### Purpose of Liangban

* The purpose of cold dishes is to add flavor to tasteless or bland ingredients, such as chicken breast.

### What can be put in Liangban?

Including but not limited to:

* Main ingredients
* Auxiliary ingredients
* Marinades
* Seasonings

### Precautions

* When making cold dishes, you should pay attention to food safety. Do not make cold dishes when you are not sure if the ingredients are safe. Do not make cold dishes when you confirm that the ingredients are unsafe.
* Cold dishes should maximize the contact area of the main ingredients, so knife flowers, slicing, smashing, or even mincing are recommended.
* Cold dishes pose basic requirements for the stomach and intestines. Please use cold dishes when confirming that there will be no "spraying" (diarrhea).
* (Historical Note: This file was written during the COVID-19 pandemic. It suggests heating all ingredients above 100°C for more than 15 seconds for psychological comfort. If you want safety, try to avoid raw cold dishes.)

## Utensils

Any container can be used, from porcelain jars to food-grade plastic bags.

### Precautions

* To facilitate stirring without splashing ingredients, it is more appropriate to use a rigid container with a volume more than twice that of all ingredients.
* To ensure food safety, please move the ingredients to a porcelain or metal container as soon as possible after marinating in a plastic bag or plastic bowl.
* To ensure food safety, please process raw food ingredients and auxiliary ingredients on a clean cutting board.

## Process

### Flaky Vegetable Main Ingredient Processing (Optional) (Single or Multiple Choice)

Examples: Cabbage, iceberg lettuce, baby cabbage, onion, etc.

* Tear ingredients into 4cm * 4cm small pieces.
* Cut ingredients into 0.5cm long strips.
* Use the whole leaf after cutting off the unused parts.
* Blanch the processed ingredients.

#### Precautions

For some ingredients, you don't need to peel them apart. Just cut them into sections perpendicular to the axis along the axis. Those who are confident in their knife skills can cut directly perpendicular to the axis.

### Block Vegetable Main Ingredient Processing (Optional) (Single or Multiple Choice)

Examples: Potatoes, water chestnuts, cucumbers, etc.

* Cut ingredients into 0.5cm * 0.5cm cross-section long strips.
* Cut ingredients into 4cm * 4cm slices with a thickness of less than 0.5cm.
* Smash or crush the ingredients with the flat of a knife (especially suitable for cucumbers).
* Use ingredients directly (especially suitable for ingredients that are naturally small blocks).
* Blanch the processed ingredients.

#### Precautions

Smashing ingredients may cause splashing. You can wrap them in a food-grade plastic bag before smashing.

### Block Fungus Main Ingredient Processing (Optional) (Single or Multiple Choice)

Examples: various mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, etc.

* Soak the ingredients (if dried).
* Cut ingredients into 0.5cm * 0.5cm cross-section long strips.
* Cut ingredients into 4cm * 4cm slices with a thickness of less than 0.5cm.
* Use ingredients directly (especially suitable for ingredients that are naturally small blocks).
* Blanch the processed ingredients.

#### Precautions

All fungi need to be strictly confirmed for safety. "Lying on a board" (death) is just one step away.

### Block Meat Main Ingredient Processing (Optional) (Single or Multiple Choice)

Examples: Fish, jellyfish head, cooked pork, cooked poultry, etc.

* Cook the ingredients by steaming, boiling, roasting, frying, etc.
* Soak the ingredients in cold water for some time (especially suitable for seafood).
* Tear the ingredients into meat strips.
* Cut the ingredients into thin slices (especially suitable for cooked pork).
* Cut the ingredients into 0.5cm * 0.5cm cross-section long strips.
* Tear directly by part or cut into large pieces (especially suitable for whole cooked poultry).

#### Precautions

* There are no exceptions for pork and poultry. They must be fully cooked (well-done), and no blood water should be seen.
* Some beef, fish, and seafood can be eaten raw after confirming safety.

### "I Think This Works Too" Ingredient Processing (Avoid if possible) (Must Choose)

Examples: Noodles, rice, fruits, tender leaves, etc.

* Confirm ingredient safety.
* Process ingredients into an edible state.
* Process ingredients into a state suitable for mixing.

#### Precautions

* Please confirm ingredient safety. You can mince a small amount of ingredients and paste it on your upper arm for 30 minutes to check for allergic reactions. If there is an abnormality, it must be discarded.
* Most leaves and grasses contain components that cause discomfort, even after cooking. Please confirm safety.
* Most grains are not conducive to digestion and absorption before cooking and may have adverse effects on the stomach and intestines.

### Auxiliary Ingredient Processing (Optional) (Single or Multiple Choice)

Examples: Hot peppers, garlic cloves, ginger, dried chili, etc.

* Remove the stem of the hot pepper, wash it, cut off 0.5cm from the stem end, then mince or cut into sections.
* Smash the garlic clove, peel it, cut off 0.5cm from the stem end, then mince or cut into sections.
* Peel the ginger, then mince, shred, or slice.
* Crush the dried chili.
* Put the prepared ingredients into a small bowl or the container to be used for mixing.
* Add to the container: various powders, seasonings, or marinades, stir well.

#### Precautions

* The types, processing, and methods of auxiliary ingredients are extremely broad. Please do not limit your thinking, but please verify carefully, use appropriate amounts, and keep safety in mind.

### Mixing Ingredients (Optional) (Single or Multiple Choice)

* Squeeze water out of meat ingredients with high water content and drain.
* Put vegetable ingredients with high water content into a container, add about 5g of salt for every 200g, stir, let stand for 5 minutes, then drain the water.
* Add ingredients and auxiliary ingredients to the mixing container.
* Stir with washed chopsticks, spoons, or hands.
* Seal the container and shake well.
* Tilt the container to an angle where no material spills out, and rotate the container around its axis.

#### Precautions

* Ingredients with high water content may release too much water directly after adding, diluting the seasoning.
* If you find insufficient water or uneven mixing during stirring, you can add an appropriate amount of boiled water. If you cannot determine the amount, 15mL each time is best.
* Some ingredients with high water absorption rates are not recommended for mixing, as this may lead to overly heavy taste after marinating.

### Eating (Required)

* Eat the mixed ingredients directly.
* Eat the unmixed main ingredients after dipping in the dipping sauce.
* Add ingredients and dipping sauce to staple food and eat.
