# Food Safety

## Poisoning

The following foods carry a risk of poisoning:

* Unripe green tomatoes
* Undercooked kidney beans, cowpeas (green beans), [Jack beans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canavalia_ensiformis)
* Sprouted potatoes (yams), sweet potatoes, peanuts
* Improperly processed/undercooked [Daylilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylily) can cause [Colchicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine) poisoning
* Raw soy milk
* Wood ear mushrooms soaked for too long (not just wood ear, all fungi soaked for too long carry poisoning risks)
* Undercooked animal offal
* Unrecognized mushrooms or undercooked mushrooms (There is a saying: Red umbrella, white stem, eat it and lie in a coffin together. Generally, the more beautiful the mushroom, the more dangerous it is.)
* ... (Welcome to add)

Storing & cooking acidic foods in aluminum containers for a long time also carries a risk of poisoning, such as:

* Pickled cabbage (Sauerkraut)
* Dried bamboo shoots
* Ketchup
* Lemon juice
* Braised meat
* Soy sauce and pickles
* ... (Welcome to add)

## Allergies

The following are common allergenic foods (Note: Allergic reactions are generally lifelong):

Adults:

* Shrimp, crab, shellfish seafood (seafood that is not fresh and has bacterial growth)
* Peanuts
* Nuts
* Fish

Children:

* Peanuts
* Nuts
* Eggs
* Milk (mainly lactose intolerance or A1 protein intolerance)
* Wheat and soybeans

## Salmonella Infection

Salmonella is more common in animal-derived foods, including vegetables which may contain Salmonella due to fecal contamination.

The following foods carry a risk of Salmonella infection:

* Undercooked eggs
* Undercooked meat
* Unpasteurized milk

## Aflatoxin

Aflatoxin is often produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus in moldy grains, such as rice, beans, peanuts, etc. It is the strongest carcinogen known so far. It only starts to decompose when heated above 280°C, so general heating is not easy to destroy its structure.

The following foods carry a risk of Aflatoxin poisoning:

* Rotten peanuts
* Rotten rice
* Rotten corn

Note that the above foods also include their corresponding products, such as rice noodles, cornmeal; safely cultivated peanut sprouts (sprouted peanuts) can be considered safe to eat.

## 3-Nitropropionic Acid

3-Nitropropionic acid is produced by Arthrinium sacchari, a fungus commonly visible on sugarcane and coconuts. The main manifestation of poisoning is damage to the central nervous system. Symptoms in the acute phase include vomiting, dizziness, paroxysmal convulsions, lateral gaze of the eyeballs, coma, and even death. The sequelae are mainly extrapyramidal damage, with main symptoms including flexion, torsion, spasm, limb rigidity, and hypotonia at rest. There is no specific antidote for this toxin.

The following foods carry a risk of 3-Nitropropionic acid poisoning:

* Red heart sugarcane
* [Rotten coconuts](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1w84y147TU)

In addition to visual appearance as a judgment criterion, smell is also an important evaluation criterion. Rotten plants often emit special smells (smell of distilled grains, sour smell, etc.). The best way to deal with food that smells rotten is to discard it.

## Parasites

Parasites can enter the human body through air, drinking water, food, and direct contact. If parasites enter the human circulatory system, they can attack white blood cells on one hand, and reach lungs, liver, and other organs or block blood vessels or lymphatic vessels on the other hand, causing diseases such as liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and elephantiasis. If humans are intermediate hosts of pork tapeworm, parasites can even reach the eyeballs, heart, and brain, endangering life.

The following foods are best ensured to be completely cooked, otherwise corresponding parasites may remain in the body:

* River snails: Angiostrongylus cantonensis
* Sashimi: Liver fluke
* Swamp eel: Gnathostoma spinigerum
* Bullfrog: Spirometra mansoni
* Pork: Pork tapeworm (Taenia solium)
* Beef surface (can be eaten as long as the surface is cooked): Beef tapeworm (Taenia saginata)

## Food Safety Temperatures

Heating food to a sufficient temperature and maintaining it for a certain period can reduce the risk of surviving bacteria and parasites to a certain extent.
Various foods have different temperature requirements. Cooks should use a kitchen thermometer to measure the center temperature of the food.

Measuring temperature should use: Kitchen thermometer
Measure food center temperature

The following are industry-standard food safety temperatures:

| | Whole Piece | Ground Meat | Whole |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pork | 71°C | 71°C | |
| Poultry | 74°C | 74°C | 85°C |
| Beef/Lamb | Rare: 63°C; Medium: 71°C; Well Done: 77°C | 71°C | |
| Leftovers Reheating | 74°C | | |
