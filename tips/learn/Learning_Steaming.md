# Steaming

## Methods

### Steamer Pot (Zheng Guo)

A steamer pot is a multi-layer structure. The bottom layer is used to hold water. After the water boils, the heat of the water vapor is used to heat the food in the upper layers.

Add appropriate water to the bottom layer of the steamer —— Place food in the upper steamer drawer —— Heat the steamer on the fire

### Iron Wok (Tie Guo)

If you don't have a steamer, only a standard iron wok (not a flat-bottom pan), you can place a tripod (steaming rack) at the bottom of the pot and inject enough water to achieve an effect similar to a steamer.

Add enough water to the bottom of the iron wok —— Put in the tripod —— Place food on the tripod —— Turn on fire and cover lid

## Precautions

* Since the heat source is water vapor, the bottom of the food in the lower steamer drawer may be soaked by water. You can put a steamer cloth under the food to avoid this. Using chopsticks to build a simple stand for food also works.
* You can use a smart device to set a timer to remind you to turn off the fire, to prevent forgetting and boiling dry.
* During the process of steaming food, pay attention to the remaining water in the bottom area, **especially in iron woks**, to avoid drying the pot and causing safety problems.
* (Optional) When steaming food in an iron wok, you can place a steaming plate on top of the tripod.
