# Using an Air Fryer

## What is an Air Fryer?

An air fryer is an electronic cooking appliance that uses air to replace hot oil for heating, cooking food, and allowing ingredients to achieve an effect similar to deep-frying without encountering oil.

### Working Principle

The air fryer uses a heater above to generate high-temperature hot air, allowing the hot air to circulate and convect around the food, quickly heating the food's own fats, taking away the food's moisture, producing a frying effect, and creating a crispiness similar to fried food.

### Advantages

* Since no cooking oil needs to be added, intake of cooking oil containing high amounts of fat and calories can be **significantly reduced**.
* High-speed circulating hot air dehydrates food, making the surface golden and crisp, leaving the food charred on the outside and tender on the inside.
* Simple operation, friendly to newcomers.

## Process

* Place the air fryer on a stable, flat, and level heat-resistant surface.
* Remove the frying pan, put the ingredients into the frying basket, and slide the frying pan into the product.
* Modify the preset temperature and rotate the knob to adjust the cooking time.
* After adjusting the cooking time, the product will start cooking. Wait for the timer to ring when cooking is complete.
* Pour all the food in the frying basket into a bowl or plate. Be sure to remove the frying basket containing the raw materials from the frying pan used, because there **may be residual hot oil or grease** at the bottom of the frying pan.

## Precautions

* When using an air fryer, pay attention not to set the temperature too high (try to be within 120°C, preferably not exceeding 168°C), and the production time should not be too long (about 10 minutes), to avoid generating too much harmful component [Acrylamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylamide).
* Reduce cooking starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, fried dough sticks, etc., in air fryers to correspondingly reduce [Acrylamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylamide) intake. Relatively speaking, air fryers are suitable for cooking foods with higher fat or moisture content, such as meat and vegetables.
* During use, do not block the air inlet on the top and the air outlet on the back. If blocked by hand, you may be **scalded by hot air**.
* The temperature difference of fryers of different brands can reach ±10°C. For the first attempt, it is recommended to reduce the time by 10% and then adjust gradually.

## Cooking Suggestions

### Common Foods

| Food Name | Temp (°C) | Time (min) | Method Steps |
|---------|---------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **French Fries** | 200 | 15-20 | 1. No need to thaw frozen fries, spray a small amount of oil on surface; 2. Spread flat in basket (no overlap), shake every 5 mins; 3. Can adjust to 210°C for last 2 mins for color. |
| **Chicken Wings** | 180 | 18-22 | 1. Cut wings, marinate with soy sauce, cooking wine, oyster sauce, minced garlic for 1 hour; 2. Spread flat, brush honey water on surface; 3. Flip after 10 mins and continue roasting. |
| **Fish** | 180-190 | 12-15 | 1. Cut both sides of fish, marinate with ginger, scallion, salt, cooking wine for 20 mins; 2. Brush oil on surface, line with foil to prevent sticking; 3. Flip once halfway. |
| **Steak** | 200 | 8-12 | 1. Warm steak to room temp, sprinkle salt, black pepper, olive oil on both sides; 2. Preheat fryer for 5 mins, cook according to thickness (4-6 mins per side). |
| **Beef Cubes** | 180 | 15-18 | 1. Cut beef into 2cm cubes, marinate with soy sauce, starch, black pepper for 30 mins; 2. Spread flat, flip once after 10 mins; 3. Can roast with onions and peppers. |
| **Pork Chops** | 175-185 | 16-20 | 1. Loosen pork chop with knife back, marinate with soy sauce, garlic powder, five-spice powder for 40 mins; 2. Spray oil on surface, line with baking paper; 3. Flip halfway and brush marinade. |
| **Egg Tarts** | 170-180 | 12-15 | 1. Thaw tart crust, pour in homemade egg liquid (milk+cream+sugar+yolk); 2. No preheat needed, bake until crust is golden and center slightly charred. |
| **Cake** | 160 | 25-30 | 1. Line 6-inch mold with oil paper, pour cake batter (70% full); 2. Low temp slow bake, inserted toothpick comes out clean means done; 3. Invert to cool to prevent collapse. |
| **Pizza** | 180-190 | 8-12 | 1. No need to thaw frozen pizza, can add extra cheese; 2. Line with foil to prevent leakage, bake until cheese bubbles; 3. For homemade pizza, bake crust for 5 mins first then add toppings. |
| **Peanuts** | 160 | 10-12 | 1. Soak raw peanuts for 5 mins then drain; 2. Spray small amount of oil + salt and mix; 3. Spread flat single layer, shake every 3 mins. |

### Operational Points

1. **Pre-processing Key**
    - Meat needs to be fully thawed and surface moisture wiped dry (Steak/Pork chops recommended to return to room temperature).
    - Frozen food (Fries/Pizza) can be cooked directly, but shake/flip frequency needs to be increased.

2. **Anti-sticking Tips**
    - Fish/Cake and other sticky foods are recommended to be lined with baking paper or foil.
    - Onion slices/lemon slices can be placed at the bottom of the basket to enhance flavor and isolate juice.

3. **Coloring Control**
    - Increasing 10-20°C for the last 2-3 minutes can make the surface crispier (suitable for fries/chicken wings).
    - Covering egg tarts/cakes with foil can prevent excessive charring.

4. **Doneness Detection**
    - Meat: Press with chopsticks, firm means well done, soft and elastic means medium.
    - Cake: Toothpick inserted into center without batter sticking means done.
