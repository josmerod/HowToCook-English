# Blanching (Chao Shui)

Blanching is a process in cooking, pronounced `chāo shuǐ`.

Blanching refers to putting preliminarily processed raw materials in a boiling water pot and heating them until they are half-cooked or fully cooked, then taking them out for further cooking or seasoning.

Blanching is an indispensable process in cooking, especially for cold dishes. It plays a key role in the color, aroma, and taste of the dish, especially the color.

Most vegetables and raw meat materials with fishy or gamy odors need to be blanched.

## Operations

### Boiling Water Blanching

Boiling water blanching involves heating the water in the pot and then putting the raw materials into the pot. After putting them in, turn them over in time. The time should be short and not overcooked.

This method is mostly used for plant-based raw materials, such as celery, spinach, lettuce, etc. When blanching, pay special attention to the heat. If the time is slightly longer, the color will fade, and it will not be crisp or tender. Therefore, after putting into the pot, take them out and let them cool when the water boils slightly.

- Leafy vegetable raw materials should be blanched first and then cut into slices to avoid excessive loss of nutrients.
- When blanching, there should be plenty of water and a strong fire so that the pot can boil in time after the raw materials are put in; when blanching green leafy vegetables, they should be fished out as soon as they roll slightly.
- Vegetable raw materials should be cooled and drained immediately after blanching to avoid yellowing and rotting due to residual heat.
- When blanching vegetables, you can add an appropriate amount of salad oil such as peanut oil, corn oil, or soybean oil to maintain the emerald green color.

### Cold Water Blanching

Cold water blanching puts raw materials and cold water into the pot at the same time. The water should submerge the raw materials, and then boil it. The purpose is to ripen the raw materials and facilitate further processing.

Potatoes, carrots, etc., are large in size and not easy to ripen, so they need to be cooked for a longer time.

Some animal raw materials, such as white meat, tripe, etc., are also put into the pot with cold water and heated until ripe before further processing. Some animal raw materials used for making soup should also be put into the pot with cold water. During the heating process, nutrients gradually overflow, making the soup delicious. If a hot water pot is used, protein coagulation will occur.

- The amount of water in the pot should not be too much, just enough to submerge the raw materials.
- During the gradual heating process, the raw materials must be turned frequently so that they are heated evenly to achieve the purpose of blanching.

## Additional Precautions

- Blanching sometimes causes some unstable, soluble nutrients in raw materials to overflow. In particular, water-soluble vitamins in fresh vegetables are more easily lost.
- Animal raw materials and plant raw materials should be blanched separately; those with heavy color and taste should be blanched separately from those with light color and taste; large blocks should be blanched separately from small blocks to prevent cross-flavoring.
- After blanching animal raw materials, the soup can be used as fresh soup after skimming off the foam and clarifying.

### Blanching Meat

- Meat raw materials only need to change color after passing through boiling water. Fish them out and drain before the next step of cooking.
- After blanching meat, you need to wash off the attached blood foam and stains. Remember to wash with **warm water**, otherwise, the meat will expand with heat and contract with cold, adsorbing stains and making it impossible to wash away the blood foam.

### Blanching Vegetables

- When washing vegetables, sprinkle some salt in the clear water, which can wash out bugs in the vegetables.
- Blanched vegetables should be immediately immersed in cold water to maintain color and texture. If not immersed in cold water, the vegetables will become no longer crisp and feel rotten due to the residual heat of the boiling water.
