# Stir-fry / Pan-fry

## Utensils

You can use common metal (iron/stainless steel/aluminum) stir-fry pans/frying pans or non-stick pans.

Using aluminum containers is not recommended; see the Food Safety section for details.

### Precautions

* Methods to prevent sticking when using ordinary pans:

#### First Fry Egg Method

* Regardless of what dish you fry, fry an egg first. Do not wash the pan after frying. When frying the next dish, it will not stick.

#### Hot Pan Cool Oil Method (Re-guo Liang-you)

* Remember, it must be **Hot Pan Cool Oil**. First heat the pan.
  * Put nothing in the clean pan, dry burn it to heat it evenly and make it hot.
  * Pour in cool oil, rotate the pan so that the oil coats the entire pan (you can rotate back and forth to heat it evenly).
  * When you see gas emitting from the pan, it means the oil in the pan is hot.
  * Pour the oil out. Do not wash the pan after pouring it out.
  * You can repeat the above steps 2-3 times to get a better non-stick effect.
  * **Note**: If using gas, fire may spray out. Pay attention to safety.

#### Hot Pan Double Oil Method

* First heat the pan.
  * Put nothing in the clean pan, dry burn it to heat it evenly and make it hot.
  * Put in a "small amount of cool oil", rotate the pan so that the oil coats the entire pan.
  * When you see gas emitting from the pan, it means the oil in the pan is hot.
  * Check the oil level, add more cool oil if needed, and start stir-frying.
  * **Note**: If using gas, fire may spray out. Pay attention to safety.

**Supplement:**

* The purpose is to coat the bottom of the pan with oil. All household pans on the market are applicable. After coating with oil, it instantly becomes a non-stick pan.
* Frying food in a non-stick pan will not stick. The function of the non-stick pan comes from the coating on its inner wall. **Metal spatulas will scratch the coating. When using a non-stick pan, use a wooden or silicone spatula to avoid damaging the coating.**

## Process

Turn on the fire — Place the pan directly on the fire and heat it — Pour oil into the pan and heat it — Put in the dish and stir-fry — Remember to add seasonings before taking it out of the pot.

### Precautions

* When judging whether the pan/oil is hot, you can place your hand flat above the pan to feel the heat; add ingredients only after the oil is hot.
* Before pouring oil into the pan, be sure to confirm that there is no residual water inside the pan. **Water will cause hot oil to splash, causing danger.**
* Following the previous point, ingredients should be drained of water before being put into the oil pan (egg liquid is fine); similarly, do not put unthawed ingredients into the oil pan to avoid danger after the ice melts.
* **If the oil pan catches fire, DO NOT pour water to extinguish the fire.** Doing so will spread the fire. When the fire just starts, quickly turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid.
