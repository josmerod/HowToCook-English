# Removing Fishy Smell

Removing fishy smell is a process in cooking.

It refers to removing the fishy or gamy smell from meat, aquatic products, and other foods by means including but not limited to adding seasonings and blanching.

**The fishy/gamy smell is the source of flavor for some foods. Excessive removal may cause the food to lose its flavor.**

There are various ways to remove the smell, and flexible choices should be made in the cooking engineering process.

## Methods

### Adding Seasonings

Adding seasonings to ingredients is the simplest way to remove the smell. For example, for most dishes using egg liquid ([Steamed Egg Custard](../../dishes/vegetable_dish/Steamed_Egg_Custard.md), [Tomato Scrambled Eggs](../../dishes/vegetable_dish/Tomato_Scrambled_Eggs.md)), you can add salt, cooking wine, vinegar, and other seasonings during the preparation of the egg liquid to remove the smell.

When cooking certain meats, you can add spices such as Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, bay leaves, cinnamon, cumin, and chili to the soup base to remove the smell.

Finished spicy hot pot base has an extremely strong aroma, which can be added in an appropriate amount during cooking, enough to cover the fishy smell of most meats.

### Dipping Sauces

Some foods still have a strong smell after cooking. You can prepare dipping sauces to cover the smell when eating.

Common dipping sauce ingredients include: vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, bean paste, sweet noodle sauce, sesame paste, peanut butter, fermented bean curd, salt, garlic, ginger, etc.

The combination of various dipping sauces is a matter of opinion and will not be exemplified here.

### Pot Tempering (Qiang Guo)

During the stir-frying process, spices such as green onions, ginger, garlic, and dried chilies can be used to temper the pot. The aromatic substances in the spices volatilize under the action of high temperature, which can cover the smell to a certain extent and increase the flavor of the dish.

### Cold Water Blanching

Some animal raw materials have residual blood, such as: chicken, pig trotters, ribs, etc. If the residual blood is not removed, the finished dish will have a certain fishy smell.

When put into cold water, the residual blood will disperse into the water; as the temperature rises, the protein in the blood coagulates, and the blood originally dispersed in the water forms foam floating on the water surface. At this time, simply skim off the foam with a spoon to complete the smell removal. The remaining clear soup can be used as a soup base for stewed dishes to continue cooking.

### Precautions

- When blanching, seasonings such as Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, cooking wine, and green onions are often added to the pot to further strengthen the smell removal.
- Star anise has a strong aroma and should be added in moderation.
- Sichuan peppercorns are small in size but large in quantity. They may remain in the pot or even in the finished dish after addition. You can wrap them in gauze to make a spice bag or use a food-grade stainless steel spice box directly, which is convenient to pick out before serving.
