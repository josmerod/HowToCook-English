# Boiling

## Process

Pour water into the pot — Turn on the fire and heat the pot on the fire — Put in ingredients after the water boils (water rolls and a large number of bubbles emerge).

### Precautions

* Covering the pot lid when heating can speed up heating. **But doing so carries the risk of overflowing.** After continuous heating, excessively churning fluid may overflow out of the pot.
* **If it is about to overflow, turn down the heat immediately and open the lid.**
* To speed up heating and avoid overflowing, you can half-open the lid to leave a gas outlet; you can also turn down the heat in the later stage and constantly watch the situation in the pot.
* Depending on cooking needs, ingredients can also be put in cold water. However, it takes longer for the water to boil this way.
