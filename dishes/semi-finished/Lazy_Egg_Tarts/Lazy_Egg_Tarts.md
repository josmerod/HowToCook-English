Egg tarts are a common and delicious dessert. Generally speaking, making egg tarts requires mixing the custard and making the crust, which is complicated and time-consuming. However, online-purchased semi-finished products solve these problems. Beginners only need about 40 minutes to complete. From now on, as long as there is an oven at home, you can become a baking expert and bake egg tarts for your family!

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- 1 Oven (one with upper and lower heating is best, but others work too)
- 1 pair of insulated gloves
- Online-purchased egg tart custard (1 box) and egg tart crusts (1 box) (or from large supermarkets like Carrefour, Walmart, etc.)

## Calculations

Per tart:

- 1 egg tart crust
- Approx. 10ml egg tart custard, ideally filled to 4/5 of the crust

## Operation

- Preheat the oven to 200°C for 10 minutes.
- Place the egg tart crusts on the baking sheet. Pour about 10ml of custard into each crust; the specific amount depends on the size of the crust, usually 4/5 full is best.
- Place the baking sheet in the oven, 190°C upper and lower heat, and bake for 10-20 minutes. If you want to quickly brown the top (焦褐斑点), increase the top heat to 200-210°C.
- It's ready when brown spots appear on the custard and the crust is completely fluffy and slightly oily.

## Additional Content

- You can adjust the time according to the size of the brown spots if needed.
- You can add 10g of shredded cheese to the egg tart to make a cheese egg tart~
