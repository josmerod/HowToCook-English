## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Frozen Sweet Dumplings
- Microwave

## Calculations

Per portion:

- Frozen Sweet Dumplings: 11 pieces. The quantity depends on the size of the bowl. Ensure the top of the dumplings is no higher than the bowl height - 5mm.

## Operation

- Take out the frozen sweet dumplings and place them in a bowl.
- Pour in boiling water until the dumplings are submerged.
- Microwave on high for 4 minutes.
- If the dumplings have absorbed water and puffed up, they are cooked.
- If they are not cooked, heat for another 1 minute.

## Additional Content

- NOTE: Add the dumplings first and then the hot water; do not reverse this, otherwise the dumplings may splash and cause burns when poured into hot water. In addition, it's harder to control the water level, which may cause overflow.
- If the bowl in the microwave is too hot to take out, you can use a towel, or some microwaves allow you to take out the tray together with the bowl.
