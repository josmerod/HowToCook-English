# Air Fryer Lamb Chops

Super lazy person's version of air fryer lamb chops. The taste is decent, depending mostly on the quality of the lamb chops.

- Total Cooking Time: 40 minutes (5 mins prep + 20 mins marinating + 15 mins cooking)
- Actual Active Time: 10 minutes

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Essential: Lamb Chops (Recommended to buy French-style lamb shoulder chops, 500g/bag with three pieces).
- Essential: Black Pepper Mixed Steak Seasoning.
- Essential: Garlic Sauce.
- Essential: Kitchen Paper.
- Optional: Butter.
- Optional: BBQ Seasoning.
- Optional: Dried Basil.
- Optional: Air Fryer Rack (Using a rack results in less oil and more even cooking on the bottom, but is harder to clean. Not using one allows for more flavor infusion. Choice is yours).

## Calculations

- 1 Lamb chop is approx. 160g
- Black Pepper Mixed Steak Seasoning 5g
- Garlic Sauce 20g
- Butter 10g or BBQ Seasoning 20g

## Operation

- Wash the lamb chops in a bowl of clear water to remove blood.
- Dry the lamb chops with kitchen paper. Rub both sides with black pepper mixed steak seasoning and garlic sauce. Let marinate for 20 minutes.
- Place the lamb chops on the rack in a foil bowl. Sprinkle with dried basil. Place butter or BBQ seasoning on top of the lamb chops. Air fry at 180°C for 10 minutes.
- Flip the lamb chops. Sprinkle with dried basil. Spoon the melted butter or seasoning from the foil bowl back onto the lamb chops. Air fry at 180°C for 5 minutes (you can add a bit more time according to personal preference; the time listed here ensures they won't burn).

## Additional Content

- It's recommended to use an air fryer with good temperature control to avoid burning.
