# French Fries

![French Fries](./French_Fries.jpg)

French fries 🍟 are a fast food item (though in some countries they may not be considered fast food) made by cutting potatoes 🥔 into strips and then deep-frying them. Compared to deep-frying, an air fryer may be easier to avoid "crashing" and achieve "asynchronous non-blocking." Compared to cutting your own potatoes, washing away starch, and spraying with oil, using semi-finished fries may significantly reduce calorie consumption *before* calorie intake—rounding up means it significantly reduces calorie consumption ~~before calorie intake~~.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- 1 bag of semi-finished fries (recommended brand: McCain)
- 1 air fryer (for crispiness, avoid cheap off-brand ones)

> Note: Different cooking tools may have different ways to make fries; only the "air fryer" method is introduced here.

## Calculations

- As a staple: 400g for 1 person (based on semi-finished weight)
- As a snack: 1/4 the staple portion weight ± 50g per person

> Use the above conditions to calculate the amount of materials according to demand (including but not limited to daily appetite, mood, and pre-meal exercise).

## Operation

### Opening the Fries

- When opening a large bag of semi-finished fries, keep the opening small; this can effectively reduce frost on the surface of the fries during long-term storage.

### Preheating the Air Fryer

- Plug it in and preheat at 200°C for 5 minutes.
- The purpose of preheating is to ensure that the temperature inside the fryer is already at the cooking temperature when the ingredients are added.
- Note: Take out the fries *after* preheating; do not wait for the fries to soften before frying.

### Frying the Fries

- Take out the fries and place them in the air fryer, 200°C for 20 minutes.
- Note that semi-finished fries already contain oil, so if you want to play games "asynchronously," use tongs or another tool.
- At 5-10 minutes, take out the basket and shake to ensure the fries are heated evenly and to prevent sticking.

### Crisping (Optional)

- At 10-15 minutes, take out the basket and spray a layer of oil covering 2/3 of the surface area of the already dried fries.

### Removal & Serving

- If you like crispy fries, take out the basket and "dance" with it to let air flow over the fries' surface before plating. If you like soft fries, just plate them directly. Better with dipping sauce or dressing.
