## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Rice Cooker
* Southern Rice (Indica) or Northern Rice (Japonica)

Finger Tip Water Measurement Method (A method for accurately determining the rice-to-water ratio):

* For Southern Rice (Indica): Put rice and water in the rice cooker container. When the index finger touches the rice, the water level should just cover the first joint and reach 1/4 of the second joint of the index finger (approx. 2.6 cm).
* For Northern Rice (Japonica): Put rice and water in the rice cooker container. When the index finger touches the rice, the water level should just cover the first joint of the index finger (approx. 2 cm).

Use the above conditions to calculate the planned raw material proportions.

## Operation

* Add rice and water to the rice cooker.
* Connect the rice cooker power and enter heating mode. Wait approximately 30 minutes.
* Wait for the rice cooker to automatically enter "Keep Warm" mode.
