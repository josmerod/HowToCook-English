# Egg Fried Rice

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Cold Rice
* Eggs
* Ham
* Cucumber
* Carrot
* Oil
* Salt
* Pepper Powder
* Light Soy Sauce
* Scallion
* Shadow-shredded Beef / Lunch Meat / Sausage / Braised Meat... etc. cooked meat (Optional)

When preparing rice, refer to [Rice Cooker Steamed Rice](./Rice/Rice_Cooker_Steamed_Rice.md).

## Calculations

Determine the number of portions before each preparation. One portion is exactly enough for 1-2 people.

Total:

* Cold Rice (Portions * 500ml)
* Eggs (Portions * 1.5 // 1 round down)
* Ham (Portions * 2 pieces)
* Cucumber (Optional, Portions * 30g)
* Carrot (Optional, Portions * 30g)
* Oil (Portions * 12ml)
* Salt (Portions * 4g - Portions * 6g)
* Pepper Powder (Portions * 8g)
* Scallion (Portions * 1 plant)
* Light Soy Sauce (Portions * 10ml)

Use the above conditions to calculate the planned raw material proportions.

## Operation

* Break the cold rice into small pieces with a spatula in advance.
* Slice or cube ham sausage, carrot, cucumber, etc., according to needs.
* If you have cooked meat at home, prepare it for better flavor.
* Separate the egg whites and yolks into two large bowls and beat them individually. Note: Do not add salt at this step.
* Heat the wok over high heat. When it starts to smoke, add cooking oil. Pour in the egg whites. Once mostly solidified, remove and set aside.
* If there is enough oil, directly add the egg yolks. If not, add more oil and wait for it to heat up over high heat.
* Once the egg yolks are mostly solidified, turn the heat down to medium-low. Add ham, cooked meat, carrot, cucumber, and other ingredients. Stir-fry for 10 seconds (until fragrant).
* Put the egg whites back in, stir-fry for 5s, then quickly add the rice and stir-fry over high heat. The goal is for every grain of rice to be coated with egg.
* During the stir-frying process, break up any large clumps of rice. This step takes a while. Stir-fry evenly after all clumps are broken.
* Adjust to low heat and add salt, pepper powder, and light soy sauce.
* Further stir-fry evenly. It's ready when you see some rice "jumping" in the wok.
* Finally, add scallions and stir-fry for another 10s.
* Turn off the heat and serve in a bowl.

## Additional Content

* Technical Summary
  - Overnight cold rice is best for stir-frying. If you don't have cold rice, you can cook it fresh (and use the refrigerator to cool it quickly), but achieving a "separate grain" texture will take longer stir-frying.
  - Doing a "separate grain" stir-fried rice essentially means stir-frying the rice until it's dry. Overnight rice is used because it has already lost some moisture.
