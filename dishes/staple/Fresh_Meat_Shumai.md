# Fresh Meat Shumai (Siu Mai)

Fresh Meat Shumai features a filling primarily made of pork with a 3:7 fat-to-lean ratio, blended with winter bamboo shoots, pork skin jelly (pizheng), and shiitake mushrooms. When steamed, it produces a semi-transparent wrapper and juicy filling. One bite releases succulent juices—a perfect balance of savory and fresh, showcasing the elegance of Jiangnan cuisine.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Shumai wrappers
- Minced pork (Fat-to-lean ratio 3:7; for a low-fat version, use pork tenderloin or front leg meat)
- Minced ginger
- Chopped scallion (green parts only)
- Light soy sauce
- Cooking wine
- Salt
- Sugar (Optional)
- White pepper powder (Optional)
- Sesame oil
- Broth or bouillon cube (Nongtangbao)
- Winter bamboo shoots (Optional)
- Pork skin jelly (Optional but recommended)
- Shiitake mushrooms (or dried, rehydrated; optional)
- Shrimp (Optional)
- Lard (or chicken fat) (for low-fat version)
- Composite food thickener (κ-carrageenan 45%, guar gum 35%, potassium chloride 20%) (or cornstarch) (for low-fat version)
- Steamer liner (Recommended order: oiled bamboo mat, straw mat, reed leaves, perforated silicone parchment paper. Traditionally straw mats were used; now perforated silicone paper is more common)

## Calculations

Determine the number of portions before each preparation. One portion is enough for 2-3 people.

Per portion:

- Shumai wrappers 240-465g (approx. 24-31 sheets, recommend 30 sheets of 10g each)
- Minced pork 300g (low-fat version: use 280g lean pork)
- Minced ginger 5-10g
- Chopped scallion 10-20g
- Light soy sauce 15 ml
- Cooking wine 10 ml
- Salt 3-5g (if using bouillon, reduce by 3g)
- Sugar 2-3g
- White pepper powder 2g
- Sesame oil 5 ml
- Broth 30 ml
- Bouillon cube 6g (Recommend Knorr brand, about 1/8 of a cube)
- Winter bamboo shoots 50g
- Pork skin jelly 100g
- Shiitake mushrooms 75g (or 30g dried, rehydrated)
- Shrimp 100-200g (approx. 20-25 pieces)
- Composite thickener 1.2g (or cornstarch 2g)
- Lard (or chicken fat) 15g

## Operation

- (Low-fat version) Mix the thickener with 10 ml of cold water into a paste.
- (Low-fat version) Add 25 ml of boiling water and stir into a semi-transparent gel.
- (Low-fat version) After cooling, mix with 280g pure lean minced pork and 15g of melted lard (or chicken fat).
- Mix the minced pork with ginger and scallion. Add soy sauce, cooking wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper. Stir in one direction until the meat becomes "elastic" (shang jin).
- If using a bouillon cube, dissolve 1/8 cube in 15 ml of hot water until fully dispersed, then add another 15 ml of room-temperature water.
- Slowly add the water or broth while continuing to stir until the meat absorbs the liquid and becomes sticky. If the filling feels too thick, add another 5 ml of water and continue stirring.
- Add optional ingredients (bamboo shoots, pork skin jelly, shiitake). Finally, drizzle with sesame oil and mix well. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to let the flavors meld.
- Take one wrapper and place about 20-25g of filling in the center (don't be too greedy, or it won't close).
- Use your thumb and index finger (Hukou) to gently gather the edges of the wrapper, forming a "vase" shape with the top remaining open.
- Gently press the bottom with your finger to ensure it stands stable.
- If adding shrimp, place one shrimp on top.
- Repeat until all shumai are wrapped.
- Place them in the steamer, spaced apart to avoid sticking.
- Steam over high heat for 8-10 minutes.

## Additional Content

- The fat in shumai mainly comes from the pork fat. When the fat is removed in the low-fat version, a small amount of animal fat is added back to compensate for the texture.
- If shumai wrappers are unavailable, use large wonton wrappers or roll out dumpling wrappers until thin.
- Wrapper diameter should be 8-10 cm, weighing about 10-15g each. The ratio of wrapper to filling should be between 1:2 and 1:2.5.
- A meat grinder should be used on medium setting so the meat is neither too fine (like paste) nor too coarse (like chunks), maintaining a texture with a "bounce" (Q-dan).
- Using 5g of ginger and 10g of scallion won't overpower the meat flavor; using 10g/20g makes it taste more like dumpling filling.
- Rub a bit of oil on your hand when wrapping to prevent the wrapper from sticking.
- Make sure the water is already boiling before you start steaming, otherwise the wrappers will collapse.
- Extra shumai can be frozen at -18 °C. Frozen ones need to be steamed for 12-15 minutes.
- Tastes better dipped in rose rice vinegar. You can also pair with Xiangyang chili sauce, chili oil, light soy sauce, or ginger shreds according to taste.
