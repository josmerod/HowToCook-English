## Calculations

Determine the number of portions before each preparation. The following amounts are exactly enough for 1 person.

Total:

- Dried Fine Noodles: 1 bunch (according to appetite) 50-100g
- Tomato: 1, approx. 200g
- 1-2 Eggs
- Salt 5g
- Oyster sauce 5g or chicken essence 3g
- White sugar 2g
- Soy sauce 5-8g
- Cooking oil 20g
- Sesame Oil 5g

## Operation

### Ingredient Pre-processing

Pre-processing is very important. No matter what dish you make, handling ingredients in advance will prevent panic during the cooking process. Cooking is a pleasant process—perhaps that's why kitchens need a dedicated prep station.

- Wash and chop scallions.
- Cut the tomato into pieces. If you're not sure how, you can search for a guide.
- Cut the green pepper into diamond-shaped pieces.
- Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat them. If they smell a bit fishy, add 2g of white vinegar to remove the odor.

### Egg Pre-processing

- Heat the pan and pour in 15-20g of cooking oil. Tender scrambled eggs need a bit more oil, which also leaves some base oil for stir-frying the tomatoes later.
- When the oil temperature reaches about 70% (you can feel the heat with your palm about 10cm away), pour in the egg liquid and scramble quickly.
- Once the eggs are solidified and there is no liquid left, transfer them to a small bowl for later. Leave some base oil in the pan.

### Making the Tomato and Egg Sauce (Saozi)

- Using the base oil in the pan, first add the white parts of the scallion and minced garlic and fry until fragrant.
- Add tomato pieces and green pepper. Sauté until the tomatoes release some juice.
- Quickly add 5g of soy sauce and 2g of white sugar.
- Stir-fry for about ten seconds, then add a bowl of clear water (just enough to almost cover the tomatoes).
- After boiling, add the scrambled eggs. Add 5g of oyster sauce or 2g of chicken essence for freshness.
- Reduce the sauce over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. When the sauce reaches the consistency shown below, add some chopped scallion greens and sesame oil (optional). The sauce is now finished.

### Boiling the Noodles

- You don't need to wash the pot. Directly add 500ml of clear water.
- Bring to a boil and add the fine dried noodles. When the noodles soften, add 100ml of cold water.
- Bring back to a boil. If the noodles float, add another 100ml of cold water.
- Bring back to a boil and check if the sides of the noodles are transparent. If they are, they are cooked.
- Transfer the noodles to the sauce bowl and mix well.

## Additional Content

- You can add 2g of black pepper to the egg liquid for better flavor.
- Adding 2g of white pepper powder when simmering the sauce enhances the spicy-savory flavor.
- It's also fine to cook the noodles through in one go. Adding water multiple times is to make the texture chewier and prevent sticking. The trick is to add cold water as soon as it boils, repeating two or three times.
