## Operation

### Preparation

* Cut the green beans into 5cm - 6cm segments.
* Cut the scallion into 1cm - 2cm segments.
* Cut the ginger into 1mm x 1mm x 3cm strips.
* Smash the garlic on a chopping board and mince into 1mm pieces.
* Slice the pork belly into 2mm thick pieces.

* First, heat the wok until all moisture is gone. Place your hand 10cm above the bottom of the wok; it should feel noticeably hot.
* Add the measured cooking oil. Hold the handle and tilt the wok about 5cm above the stove, swirling it so the oil coats two-thirds of the inner surface.

> PS: If using a non-stick pan, ignore the above and just wait 3-5 seconds for the oil to heat up.

* Add all the ginger and scallion segments, stir-fry for 5 seconds until fragrant (be careful of oil splashes!).
* Add all the pork slices. Don't rush to stir; let them sit for 5 seconds before stir-frying until they are all coated with oil.
* Continue to stir-fry the pork. Once the color has changed, drizzle the light soy sauce evenly along the edge of the wok and stir-fry.
* Successively add salt, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, thirteen spices, chicken essence, and all the green beans. Stir-fry for 2 minutes.
* Add the hot water.
* When the water boils, use a ladle to scoop out half of the cooking liquid (Note: do not scoop out the beans or meat).
* Spread all the noodles evenly over the top of the beans.
* Cover and braise over medium heat for 5 minutes.
* Open the lid and use a ladle to drizzle the reserved cooking liquid evenly over the noodles, one spoonful at a time.
* Cover and braise over medium heat for another 3 minutes.
* Open the lid and sprinkle all the garlic and MSG evenly.

> PS: There might still be some liquid in the wok. If you prefer the noodles wetter, turn off the heat now; otherwise, keep cooking for a bit.

* Use chopsticks to constantly toss and mix the noodles with the vegetables and meat.
* Turn off the heat.
