## Additional Content

* Scallion, ginger, and garlic are additional seasonings; adding them can enhance the flavor, but it's fine without them.
* The amount of sugar and salt depends on personal taste; please add accordingly.
* It's recommended to use a bowl as the final serving vessel because using a plate makes eating the noodles more difficult.
* The overall flavor is relatively spicy; if you can't eat spicy food, please reduce the amount of chili oil and do not add bird's eye chili.
