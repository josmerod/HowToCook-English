## Operation

- Dice onion, carrot, ham, or chicken breast. Set aside.

- Add ham or chicken breast cubes, fry until cooked.
- Add rice and stir-fry until separated, then add 20ml of ketchup and stir-fry evenly. Remove the fried rice and set aside.
- Beat eggs, add 10ml of milk, and mix well.
- Add 5ml of oil to the pan, pour in the egg mixture, and gently tilt the pan so the eggs cover the bottom evenly.
- Heat over low heat until the surface is semi-cooked, then place the fried rice in the center of the eggs.
- Use a spatula to fold the sides of the omelet over the rice, forming an oval shape.
- Carefully slide onto a plate, adjust the shape, and drizzle extra ketchup on top for decoration.

## Additional Content

- Using overnight rice prevents sticking and provides a better texture.
- Adding milk to the eggs makes the omelet more tender and smooth.
- Use low heat when making the omelet to avoid burning the bottom.
- If you're not good at wrapping, you can just serve the rice first and place the omelet on top.
