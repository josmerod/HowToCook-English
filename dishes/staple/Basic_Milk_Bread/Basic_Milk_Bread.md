## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Required Ingredients


- High Gluten or Medium Gluten Flour *（Try to use High Gluten Flour, but **Avoid using Low Gluten Flour**. All "All-purpose Flour" without special instruction are Medium Gluten Flour）*
- Egg *（No excessive requirement on size and weight）*
- Sugar *（If have Syrup is best.）*
- Dry Yeast
- Salt
- Milk or Heavy Cream or Condensed Milk or Milk Powder *（Best use **Milk Powder**, milk fragrance full, but **Do not use any Compound Milk Powder**, such as Adult Milk Powder or Infant Milk Powder, because chemical properties unstable. Meanwhile can mix use two kinds of dairy products. Try to **Avoid choosing extra sugar containing** ingredients, because actual sugar content will be more than this recipe suggested added sugar amount）*

### Optional Materials, Tools and Introduction to Materials, Tools

>![Tool 1](./Tool_Introduction_1.jpg)
>![Tool 2](./Tool_Introduction_2.jpg)
>Baking is independent food production category, therefore has big difference from daily cooking tools. Below introduced commonly used tools.
>
>- ①Measuring Cup: Measure ingredients. Measuring Cup generally will use cup as measurement unit. Do not shake when measuring, prevent measured ingredients be less.
>- ②Spatula: Also named Silicon Shovel, used for stirring and scraping batter attached to container edge etc.
>- ③Cloth: Cover on dough surface prevent losing too much moisture during production process. In production process select use wet or dry cloth according to actual situation. Suggest use Steaming Basket Cloth (Not disposable Steaming Cloth), can also use Plastic Wrap.
>- ④Oven: Bake ingredients. Oven divided into small Economic Oven and large Professional Oven. Economic Oven because poor airtightness, therefore might heat unevenly, at this time can lower temperature extend baking time. Oven must preheat first. Later chapters will expand detail.
>- ⑤Scraper: Scrape dough on kneading board and cut dough into appropriate size. Can also use clean knife substitute.
>- ⑥Rolling Pin: Press dough.
>- ⑦Spray Bottle: Make dough or container surface evenly cover water or oil, used for baking crispy skin and anti-stick.
>- ⑧sieve: Make flour spread evenly or filter flour lumps and impurities.
>- ⑨Kneading Board or Silicone Mat: Perform kneading dough operation above it, prevent polluting dough and other places.
>- ⑩Brush: Used for brushing egg liquid to dough, make finished product more bright, beautiful, shiny.
>- 11.Silicon Oil Paper: Prevent sticking with other items when baking, make baked finished product hard to de-mold. Silicon Oil Paper is high temperature resistant, no safety problem. Part of Silicon Oil Paper distinguish front and back, pay attention when using.
>- 12.Mold: Help bread shaping when baking. No excessive requirements for bread baking molds, but mold for cake baking must be Anodized Aluminum material and best spray oil flour mixture help cake climb.
>- Gluten Powder: This is protein extracted from wheat, will form grid structure after absorbing water. Widely applied in daily life, such as Gluten etc.
>- Vanilla Extract: Vanilla Extract is natural edible essence highly purified from vanilla. Often used to make vanilla flavor food besides also used to neutralize egg fishy smell etc. odors.

## Calculations

**Note: Although gave specific usage of ingredients, but indoor temperature, indoor humidity even yeast content in air will all affect production process. This recipe will give adjustment suggestions as much as possible during production process.**

cup is commonly used baking measurement unit, because can easily convert between volume and weight. 1 cup = 250 ml , generally, 1 cup Flour = 120 g . More conversions see Additional Content.

Here, used larger amount use cup , smaller use g .

Per serving:

- **Sponge (Starter)**
  - Flour 1 cup (After scooping a cup use spoon scrape off excess part, don't shake)
  - 30 ℃ Warm Water (Not hot to hand is suitable) 1 cup
  - Yeast 2 g
  - Salt 2 g
- **Dough**
  - Flour 2½ cup
  - Egg 1
  - Sugar or Syrup ⅛ cup
  - Dairy Product Mixed total ¼ cup (Milk Powder need mix with water.)
  - Butter or Corn Oil ⅛ cup
  - Gluten Powder ¼ ~ ½ cup (Optional)
  - Vanilla Extract 3 g (Optional)

## Operation

### Sponge Production

Sponge is product of pre-fermentation, through pre-fermentation, not only can improve success rate, strictly speaking longer fermentation time will let bread flavor better. If have condition, sponge should ferment 4 days to reach best flavor. But for beginner, 30 minutes fermentation sponge presented finished product already very impressive. Next make sponge.

![Ideal state of sponge before fermentation](./Sponge_1.jpg)

1. First, mix Yeast and ***30℃ Warm Water*** evenly using Spatula or Kitchenware, stand 5 minutes. Afterward mix with Flour, stir evenly. Sponge at this time should be **Specially Viscous** batter.

![Cover sponge simply with cloth](./Sponge_2.jpg)

2. Use cloth cover batter, place batter to **Warm Place** proceed fermentation, duration 45 ~ 60 minutes.

![Final form of sponge](./Sponge_3.jpg)

3. Final batter should be surface has many bubbles and volume obviously increased.

**Fermentation failed? Look here:**

>1. Ensure yeast not expired
>2. Ensure water temperature suitable
>3. Extend fermentation time, can put in refrigerator overnight
>4. Maybe temperature not enough, at this time can preheat oven to 60℃ , stop heating then put into oven proceed fermentation
>5. Can add equal amount yeast stir evenly ferment again and extend fermentation time
>6. Can try add 3g sugar ferment again

**How to make "Permanent" Sponge?**

>With Sponge, bake bread anytime is not dream! "Permanent" Sponge can be made according to below method:
>
>1. After making sponge according to above method, put to cool place (Even refrigerator!) Every 1-3 days sprinkle thin layer of flour on top (As long as cannot see batter thickness is okay!) Stir again, then continue cover cloth ferment. If ferment too fast volume too big, can throw away a part.
>2. Wait until start making bread, only need leave volume of sponge before fermentation continue ferment, remaining used for bread production.
>3. As time passes, sponge will produce unique fragrance, this fragrance is best "Ingredient" for bread!

### Dough Production

With sponge, then successful half!

![Dough at this time](./Dough_State.jpg)

1.Mix all remaining ingredients with sponge using Spatula, stir. When stirring must scrape wall, make it fully mixed. When forming dough and no dry flour, use clean dry hand press dough, other hand hold container, make it form a big dough, then pour on kneading board or silicon mat operate

>At this time ground dough should already formed and relatively soft. If cannot form and very sticky, then explain flour less, can add ¼ cup flour again fully stir, until formed. If dough formed or has many dry flour, then explain kneading time not enough. At this time can increase kneading time.
>
>When pressing dough, use fist push away dough, then fold push away again, so back and forth, knead all flour on container wall into dough.

2.Use lower palm push away dough, then fold push away again, until surface no dry flour lumps. Dough at this time still not very smooth.

>If use kneading board in this process, might have small part adhesion, at this time can use Scraper or Knife shovel it down.
>
>If dough formed but relatively hard, then explain moisture too little. At this time can use wet hand or Spray Bottle on surface evenly cover water and cover wet cloth stand ferment 20 minutes, so back and forth.

![Transfer into container](./Transfer_to_Container.jpg)

3.Use Spray Bottle spray a layer of vegetable oil (Can also use hand smear evenly) in container at least three times as big as current dough, put dough in and cover cloth, ferment 1 hour.

>If fermentation happen problem, please refer to solution for fermentation failure under Sponge Production.
>
>Dough satisfying fermentation surface should be sticky. If not, can use wet hand or Spray Bottle on surface evenly cover water and ferment again 20 minutes.

4.At this time dough should have two times original size. Sprinkle thin layer of flour on kneading board or silicon mat (Can see kneading board or silicon mat thickness is enough), then take out dough, use hand press flat dough exhaust air.
5.Afterward use Rolling Pin, roll into 1 cm thick sheet. And tight, leave no gap roll up from one side.
6.Then rotate 90° , repeat step 4, step 5 .
7.Shape bread, put into baking tray padded with Silicon Oil Paper or mold smeared with grease. Note seam face down.

>Can spray evenly a layer of oil on baking tray or use butter smear thin layer then put on Silicon Oil Paper. So Silicon Oil Paper won't verify move.

8.In tray or mold, ferment 30 ~ 45 minutes .

>If fermentation happen problem, please refer to solution for fermentation failure under Sponge Production.

9.Meanwhile, preheat oven.

>Oven preheat: Adjust oven to highest temperature empty bake at least 20 minutes.

10.Use scissors or knife scratch few slits on bread as bread pattern.
11.Use brush brush on egg liquid. (Optional)

![Finished Product](./Finished_Bread.jpg)

11.Put into oven, upper lower fire 180℃ bake 30 minutes, then adjust 165 ℃ bake again 10 minutes.

>Different oven temperature different. In baking process, observe bread, if no obvious color change after 30 minutes, then temperature too low. At this time increase 5 ~ 10 ℃ or bake 5 ~ 10 minutes more
>After baking ends, taste bread, if bread surface bitter (Note, as long as not bitter not considered over baked), then temperature too high, try reduce 5 ~ 10 ℃ or reduce 5 ~ 10 minutes baking time;
>If outside already caramel color but inside not cooked, then reduce 5 ~ 15 ℃ and extend 10 ~ 20 minutes baking time.
>
>If bread surface very hard or crack very serious, can use Tinfoil cover bread and take away Tinfoil in last ten minutes or upside down another baking tray and install at top most position, then take away Tinfoil or baking tray in last 10 minutes.

12.After cooling load into food bag, can save one week. Freeze can save one month.

>When closed in food bag one night, bread internal and surface will further soften. So best tasting timing is second day morning.

2. How to save excess bread

  Can slice bread proceed freezing, when next use can place to room temperature place wait return temperature, or directly heat. But **Never put to Refrigerator Area!** Bread moisture in Refrigerator Area will quickly lose.

3. Recommend eating method

![Finished Product](./Serving_Suggestion.jpg)

a. Take a big piece of bread, up down divide into two. Put into pot low heat heat (Generally no need add oil, but if hope crispy skin can smear butter on bread surface then pan-fry) 1 ~ 2 minutes.
b. Pot use Spray Bottle spray 3 ~ 4 pump oil, high heat burn until pot slightly smoke, turn minimum heat.
c. Then put in an egg, cover lid. Wait 2 ~ 3 minutes. Then flip heat again 2 ~ 3 minutes.
(This is method for liquid center egg, if need fully cooked egg, can add at most 1 ml water before flipping, turn medium low heat, until water boil dry. So obtained a fully cooked egg)
d. Smear any sauce liked on both sides of bread, sandwich egg in middle.
