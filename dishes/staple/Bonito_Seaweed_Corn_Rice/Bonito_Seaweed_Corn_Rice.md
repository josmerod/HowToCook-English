# Bonito Seaweed Corn Rice

![Example Product](./Rice.jpg)

This is a "super lazy person's" version of rice, similar to the convenience of air fryer lamb chops. The taste is decent, mostly depending on the quality of the ingredients.

- Total Cooking Time: 40 minutes (3 mins prep + 40 mins cooking + 2 mins mixing)
- Actual Active Time: 5 minutes

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Essential: Northeast Chinese Rice (Indica or Japonica, e.g., Arawana 5kg pack). Recommended to cook with an IH Rice Cooker. Do not use a pressure cooker if possible.
- Essential: Bonito Seaweed Crumbs (Furikake style, can be searched online as "Japanese rice seasoning").
- Essential: Corn Kernels (Ready-to-eat type).

## Calculations

- Bonito Seaweed Crumbs 20g
- Corn Kernels 80g/bag

## Operation

- Prepare the steamed rice, then mix in the corn kernels.
- Sprinkle the bonito seaweed crumbs on top.

## Additional Content

- If using a small rice cooker to cook Northeast rice, the water should cover the rice by about 3mm. Too much water will result in mushy rice rather than separate grains.
