# Luosifen (Snail Rice Noodles)

Authentic Luosifen is not stinky!

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

> Considering home cooking, it is unrealistic to start the process from snails or sour bamboo shoots. Therefore, this recipe is based on packaged Luosifen.

### Ingredients

- One pack of Luosifen, which should contain:
  - Rice noodles
  - Snail meat packet (may be included in the seasoning packet)
  - Soup base packet
  - Side packets like sour bamboo shoots, peanuts, yuba (tofu skin), wood ear mushrooms, etc.
  - Seasoning packets like vinegar and chili oil

### Tools

- Pot
- Induction cooker or stove
- A pair of chopsticks

## Calculations

- Based on personal experience, one pack of Luosifen is enough for one person per meal (although it looks like a large bag).
- 1L of water

## Operation

- Add water to the pot and bring to a boil.
- Add rice noodles and cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring with chopsticks to prevent sticking.
- Add the soup base packet, adjusting to personal taste.
- Add some of the side packets, such as wood ear mushrooms, peanuts, and snail meat (these need to be cooked for a while to absorb the flavor).
- Add the seasoning packets, adjusting to personal taste.
- Stir and then remove from the pot and place in a bowl.
- Add the remaining side packets, such as sour bamboo shoots and yuba (these are not suitable for soaking in the soup for too long).
- Enjoy.
