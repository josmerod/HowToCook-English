## Operation

### Ingredient Preparation

- Remove the skin from the pork and cut it into thin slices of approx. `2 cm * 6 cm * 0.5 cm`.
- Remove the leaves from the celery, cut off 2cm from the root, then slice in half lengthwise and cut into 2cm segments.
- Peel and mince the garlic, slice the scallion into 0.2cm pieces, and cut the ginger into fine shreds.

### Pre-processing

- Heat the wok until smoking, pour in 3ml of oil to coat the pan, and then pour out the excess.
- Add more oil, then add pork slices, scallion, ginger, garlic, and dried red chili. Stir-fry for 1 minute at a steady pace.
- Add cooking wine, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce, and stir-fry for another minute.
- Add 500ml of hot water. Cover and simmer for 3 minutes.
- Add celery and green pepper, season with salt and thirteen spices, cover and continue to simmer for 3 minutes, then turn off the heat.
- Add 1000ml of water to the steamer. Once the water boils and steam arises, spread the noodles evenly on the steamer grate and steam for 15 minutes.
- After the noodles are steamed, take them out, use chopsticks (or heat-resistant hands) to separate them on a chopping board, and let them cool at room temperature.

### Final Processing

- Put the noodles into the wok with the vegetables and mix. Use chopsticks and a spatula to flip the vegetables onto the noodles until the noodles are evenly colored.
- Place the mixed noodles back onto the steamer grate and steam again for another 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.

- Technical Summary
  - When cutting pork, you can ask the vendor at the market to help. Experience shows the success rate is highest after they've cut it but before you've paid.
  - For the first time, you can prepare ingredients in advance to avoid a rush; later, you can multi-task.
  - Both times when steaming noodles, try to loosen them as much as possible to prevent them from clumping. If the noodles are too long, you can break them to make mixing and serving easier.
  - Be careful when removing the steamed noodles to avoid the grate tipping or the noodles touching the water.
  - This dish pairs perfectly with beer!
