## Calculations

## Operation

- Wash and shred the vegetables. Stir-fry in a pan until softened, then remove.
- Bring water to a boil. Blanch the beef rolls until cooked through (about three minutes), then remove.
- Fry a [sunny-side-up egg](../../breakfast/Soft_Boiled_Egg.md) (or according to preference).
- Place the [rice](../../staple/Rice/Rice_Cooker_Steamed_Rice.md) in a bowl, then invert it into a larger serving bowl.
- Arrange the prepared vegetables and beef rolls around the rice in a circle, and place the fried egg in the center.
- Prepare the sauce:
  - 10ml Korean Chili Paste + 5ml Light Soy Sauce + two bottle caps of Sprite (use sugar-free Sprite for a low-calorie version) + 10g Sesame Seeds + 5ml Sesame Oil.
  - Stir the sauce; you can add more soy sauce and salt if needed.
- Pour the prepared sauce over the arranged bowl.

## Additional Content

- This is a very simple dish. The process might be a bit tedious, but it's very satisfying when you mix the vegetables, meat, rice, and sauce together.
- If you care about the appearance, you can use a stone pot (dolsot) instead of a regular bowl.
