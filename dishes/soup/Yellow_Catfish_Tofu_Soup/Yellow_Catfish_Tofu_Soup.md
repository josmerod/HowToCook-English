## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Yellow Catfish or Sand Goby
* Tofu
* Scallion
* Ginger
* Cooking Oil
* Cooking Wine (Liaojiu)
* Salt
* Black Pepper Powder

## Calculations

Per portion:

* Yellow Catfish or Sand Goby: 1 fish
* Tofu: 100g
* Scallion: 1 stalk
* Ginger: 1 piece
* Black Pepper Powder: 3-5g
* Cooking Oil: 15ml
* Salt: 10-15g
* Boiling Water: 1L

## Operation

* Clean the fish thoroughly (pay special attention to the blood inside the belly; if not cleaned, it will be fishy). Place in a large bowl, add cooking wine, 10g of ginger slices, and 5g of salt. Marinate for 15 minutes.
* Cut the tofu into cubes, soak in cold water for 5 minutes, then drain and set aside.
* Before frying the fish, rub the pan with a ginger slice to prevent sticking. Pour in oil (15ml * number of fish). Once heated, add the fish and fry for 2-3 minutes. Shake the pan occasionally to prevent sticking and flip once.
* After the fish is fried, pour in boiling water, 5ml of cooking wine, and ginger slices. Turn from low heat to high heat, cover, and boil for 10 minutes (use slightly more water as some will evaporate).
* When the soup turns white, add the prepared tofu. Turn to medium heat and cook for 5 minutes. Add 10g of salt and 3g of black pepper powder to taste. Finally, sprinkle with chopped scallions before serving.
