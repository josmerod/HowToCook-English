# Thickened Shiitake Soup

Fresh shiitake mushrooms are not only delicious when stir-fried with meat, but they are also very tasty when made into a thick gravy soup.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Fresh Shiitake Mushrooms
* Scallion
* Cooking Oil
* Salt
* Chicken Essence
* Cornstarch (Shengfen)

## Calculations

Per portion:

* Fresh Shiitake Mushrooms: 2 pieces
* Scallion: 0.5 stalks
* Chicken Essence: 3g
* Cooking Oil: 10ml
* Salt: 3g
* Boiling Water: 350ml
* Cornstarch: 10g

## Operation

* Slice the shiitake mushrooms (0.5-1 cm thick; thicker slices have a chewier texture). Place them in a large bowl, add 2g of salt, and soak for 15 minutes.
* Pour cornstarch into a small bowl, add 50ml of water, and stir until dissolved with no lumps (this is the starch slurry).
* Pour out the salt water from the mushroom bowl and appropriately squeeze out excess moisture from the mushrooms (to facilitate frying in the next step). [Optional]
* Over low heat, pour in oil. When the oil starts to bubble slightly (about 30s on low heat, depending on stove power), add the mushrooms and fry each side for 10s. [Optional]
* Pour in 300ml of boiling water, turn to medium heat, and cook for another 3-5 minutes.
* Pour in the starch slurry, stir the soup appropriately, add 3g of salt, 3g of chicken essence, and finally sprinkle with chopped scallions before serving.
