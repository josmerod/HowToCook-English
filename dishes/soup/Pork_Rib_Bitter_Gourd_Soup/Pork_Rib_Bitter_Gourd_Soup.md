# Pork Rib Bitter Gourd Soup

Pork Rib Bitter Gourd Soup is a delicious and easy-to-cook soup. However, the cooking time for soups is generally long, so it's best to start preparations 4 hours in advance.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

Optional Tools:

- Electric Pressure Cooker (can greatly simplify the process and time)
- Clay Pot (better for stewing soup than a regular wok)

Essential Ingredients:

- Pork Ribs
- Bitter Gourd
- Dried Shrimp Skins (Xiapī)

## Calculations

Determine how many portions you plan to make. One portion is exactly enough for 4 people.
Per portion:

- Pork Ribs 250g to 500g
- Bitter Gourd 100g to 200g
- Dried Shrimp Skins 5g to 15g
- Ginger 5-10g (optional, used for blanching to remove gamey smell)

## Operation

- Wash the pork ribs and cut them into small pieces about 4cm ±2cm * 3 ± 2cm (if you don't have tools to chop ribs, ask the butcher for help).
- Pour 700ml of cold water into a wok and heat with the ribs until boiling. Turn off the heat and remove the ribs.
- Cut the bitter gourd in half, clean out the seeds and pith inside, and cut into 0.5 ± 0.3 cm strips. Wash them.

### Method 1: Using a Soup Pot

  - Pour 1100ml of water and the ribs into the soup pot over high heat.
  - Wait for the water to boil, then add the bitter gourd and dried shrimp skins. Turn to low heat and wait for 120-240 minutes (after 120 minutes, you can take out a piece of meat to taste; if the meat easily separates from the bone, you can turn off the heat).
  - When serving, add salt and white pepper. Recommended amounts are 0.3 to 0.6g of salt and 0.1 to 0.5g of white pepper per 250ml.

### Method 2: Using an Electric Pressure Cooker

  - Pour 1000ml of water, the ribs, shrimp skins, and bitter gourd into the pressure cooker.
  - Select the "Soup" function (generally pressure cooking for 45 minutes).
  - When finished, add salt and pepper as in the soup pot method.

## Additional Content

- You can use other umami-rich ingredients instead of shrimp skins, such as dried scallops (Yao Zhu).
