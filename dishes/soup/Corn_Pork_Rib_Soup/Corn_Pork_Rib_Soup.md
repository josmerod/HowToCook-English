## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Pork Ribs
* Corn
* Carrot
* Ginger
* Scallion
* Cooking Oil
* Vinegar
* Cooking Wine (Liaojiu)
* Ground Black Pepper
* Salt
* Clay Pot (if not available, an iron pot is fine)

## Calculations

Per portion:

* Pork Ribs: 500-800g
* Corn: 1 cob (add more if you like)
* Carrot: 1 piece (add more if you like)
* Scallion: 1/3 stalk
* Chopped Green Onion: 1 stalk
* Cooking Oil: 10ml
* Ground Black Pepper: 4g
* Cooking Wine: 10ml
* Vinegar: 10ml
* Salt: 10-15g (depending on the final amount of soup)
* Boiling Water: 1000ml

## Operation

### Preparation

* Cut the scallion into 3-4cm segments and crush them with the back of a knife.
* Chop the corn into small pieces.
* Cut the carrot into rolling chunks (Gundao Kuai).
* Peel and slice the ginger into large pieces.
* Cut the fresh pork ribs into small chunks.

### Cooking

* Put the ribs into a pot with cold water. Add scallion, ginger slices, and cooking wine for blanching. Bring to a boil over high heat, skim off the foam, remove the ribs, and drain.
* Heat the pot, add oil, and sauté the large ginger slices together with the ribs. When the surface of the ribs is slightly golden brown, add vinegar (to help soften the meat) and continue sautéing for one minute.
* Pour in boiling water (add enough at once; do not add more later) and bring to a boil over high heat.
* First, add the corn and ground black pepper. Cover and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Then add the carrots, cover, and continue simmering over low heat for another 40 minutes.
* Seasoning is simple: three minutes before serving, add nothing but salt. Finally, sprinkle with a handful of chopped green onions.
