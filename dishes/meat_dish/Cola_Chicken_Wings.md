# Cola Chicken Wings

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Chicken Wings (Mid-joint Wings)
* Cola
* White Sugar
* Light Soy Sauce
* Salt
* Ginger
* Cooking Wine or Beer
* Scallion (Small Green Onion)

## Calculations

Based on 1 plate portion:

* Chicken Wings: 10 ~ 12 pieces
* Cola: 500ml
* White Sugar: 10 g
* Light Soy Sauce: 15 g
* Dark Soy Sauce: 3 g
* Salt: 2 g
* Ginger: 2 slices
* Cooking Wine: 20 ml
* Scallion tied into a knot

## Operation

* Put chicken wings into pot, pour cold water to submerge. Put 1 slice of ginger and 10 ~ 20 ml cooking wine. Boil over high heat (about 2 minutes), skim off floating foam, drain water.
  * This step is for frozen chicken wings. Freshly bought chicken wings can be marinated directly with light soy sauce after cutting.
* Fish out chicken wings, make two cuts on both sides with a knife. Marinate chicken wings with about 10 g light soy sauce for 10 minutes (Ensure light soy sauce completely coats chicken wing surface).
* Heat oil in pot over low heat again, first stir-fry remaining ginger slice until fragrant, then put in marinated chicken wings. Pan-fry chicken wings until golden yellow, flip (until both sides are golden yellow), flip chicken wings with spatula, stir-fry 4~5 times with ginger slice (Purpose is to prevent chicken wings and ginger slice from sticking).
* When chicken wings are golden yellow, pour in cola to cover chicken wings, turn on high heat to boil the cola in the pot, then skim off floating black foam (containing blood water). At this time add scallion knot.
* Seasoning: Add 2 g edible salt, 10 g white sugar, 3 g light soy sauce (Can use 3 g dark soy sauce to adjust base color appropriately).
* Wait until scallion knot turns yellow, fish it out together with ginger slice, turn to medium heat to continue slow cooking cola chicken wings.
* Wait until cola presents a hanging syrup state, turn to low heat to let the juice hang firmly on the chicken wings. Serve, plate.

## Additional Content

* Adding ginger to stir-fry until fragrant can also prevent chicken wings from sticking to the pot.
* Do not use too high heat when collecting juice at the end, to prevent taste from becoming bitter.
* This dish is sweet.
