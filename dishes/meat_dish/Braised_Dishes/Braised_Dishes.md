- Soak Beef Shank in cold water for more than 3 hours in advance to remove blood water.

### Prepare Brine (Lu Shui)

- Prepare Sugar Color: Add 30g white sugar to pot, heat on low heat until sugar melts completely and turns brownish, add 150ml hot water, stir evenly and set aside.
- Cut onion into blocks, smash ginger and garlic, break dried chili for later use.

### Braise Beef

- Blanch Beef Shank in pot for 2-3 minutes, fish out and rinse off floating foam on surface with hot water.
- Put blanched Beef Shank into boiling Brine, ensure Brine submerges all meat.
- Cover Pressure Cooker lid, after steam comes up, continue cooking for 25-30 minutes.
- After cooking is done, do not open lid to keep warm, let it cool naturally and soak overnight (this makes it more flavorful).
- Take out braised meat and put in refrigerator to chill, making it firm.
- Slice before eating, can be eaten directly or dressed as cold dish.

### Preserve Brine

- Brine reuse method: After braising meat each time, filter the brine to remove all solid contents, boil again to sterilize, cool down and then refrigerate or freeze. When using, add seasonings again according to original formula proportion. (Water addition depends on brine usage situation).
- Properly preserved brine can be used for a long time, and gets more fragrant as it ages.
- **Important Note**: If braising vegetarian dishes, must take out a portion of brine to use separately, and the brine used for vegetarian dishes cannot be reused.

### Cold Dressing Seasoning

- Mix minced garlic, chopped green onion, white sesame seeds, chili powder in ratio 1:1:1:1, add millet chili according to personal taste. Add small amount of sesame oil or rattan pepper oil to hot vegetable oil, pour over the seasoning in batches, then add light soy sauce, vinegar, oyster sauce 10ml each, 5ml sugar, MSG/Chicken Essence, finally 15ml Braising Soup, mix evenly.
