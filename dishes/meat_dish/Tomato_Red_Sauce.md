# Tomato Red Sauce

Tomato Red Sauce is fragrant and delicious, rich in nutrition, which I like very much. It can be used as a versatile sauce for staple foods such as pancakes, pasta ~~Hot Dry Noodles~~ etc. It is somewhat cumbersome and suitable for people with cooking experience to try. It doesn't matter if you can't finish it at once, you can freeze it and heat it up at any time. (But remember to eat it)
