## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. One serving is exactly enough for 2-3 people.

Total Amount:

- Beef Amount = Servings * 100 g (Adjust according to diners' stomach capacity and pot capacity)
- Onion Amount = Servings * 1/12 (i.e. cut about 1/4 for 3 people)
- Bell Pepper Amount = Servings * 1/12 (i.e. cut about 1/4 for 3 people)
- Salt Amount = Servings * 1 g
- Starch = Servings * 3 g
- Black Pepper Marinade = Marinate according to ratio in instruction of purchased product
- Black Pepper Powder = Servings * 1 g (Actually sprinkle casually)
- Peanut Oil = Servings * 10ml (Actually oil amount varies with vegetable amount, if beef amount changes please change proportionally)

Use the above conditions, calculate the proportion of raw materials planned to be used.

## Operation

- Cut beef into strips, length best controlled under 8cm, thickness about 5-10mm, width about 1cm (Not strict).
- Marinate beef using marinade, mix evenly and let stand, amount and time please refer to product instruction, can be longer but not shorter.
- If using liquid marinade, sprinkle a layer of black pepper powder 3 minutes before marinating ends, then add starch, mix evenly again and let stand for 20 minutes.
- Turn on fire, heat pot, add peanut oil.
- When seeing a wisp of smoke from oil in pot, put in beef, stir-fry.
- Medium-high heat, stir-fry for 2 minutes until beef surface changes color (i.e. no obvious blood color, blood color parts mean not fried enough) (Be careful of oil splashing here).
- Put in Onion and Bell Pepper, stir-fry for 2 minutes.
- Add Salt, sprinkle another portion of Black Pepper Powder, stir-fry for 30 seconds, mix evenly.
- Observe Onion becoming soft, turn off heat, dish out, plate.
