Mouth Watering Chicken (Cold Dish). In the scorching summer, hot dishes are hard to eat, but for meat lovers,
apart from Mouth Watering Chicken, I really can't think of a better meat dish suitable for summer.
Wrapped in red oil, the chicken is bright red, icy and bouncy, delicious and not greasy. Deserves to be called a Summer Rice Killer!
