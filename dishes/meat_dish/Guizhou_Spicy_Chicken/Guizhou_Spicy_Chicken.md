## Operation

- Add oil to half height of pot. Fry potato cut into long strips until surface is golden yellow then fish out set aside. When oil temperature rises to burning hand level, put cut chicken blocks into pot to fry, and put in cut ginger slices and Sichuan peppercorn.
- When starting to fry chicken, oil is turbid because of water inside chicken blocks. Wait until oil becomes clear, chicken blocks are fried well, then fish out set aside.
- Now you can scoop out one third of oil from pot, don't need so much oil now.
- Heat remaining oil in pot, add Ciba Chili, Doubanjiang, Ginger slices, stir-fry until red oil comes out, put fried chicken blocks in and stir-fry evenly.
- Wait until chicken blocks are colored, add Dark Soy Sauce, pour in Beer. Beer must cover chicken blocks. Add Fragrant Leaf, cover lid, braise for 10 minutes, stir-fry occasionally during period.
