## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. Calculate here for 1~2 people.

+ Pork: 250g
+ Green Peppers: 3
+ Garlic Slices: 2 slices
+ Doubanjiang: 10g
+ Millet Chili: 1
+ White Sugar: 5g
+ Soy Sauce: 15ml
+ Ginger: 2 slices

## Operation

+ **Preparation Phase**: Slice the pork, preferably separating fat and lean meat. Cut green peppers and millet chili into segments, smash garlic slices into minced garlic with the back of a knife, and shred ginger. Crack eggs into a small bowl and beat with chopsticks.
+ **Cooking Phase**: Once vegetables are ready, start cooking. Pour oil into the pot first, turn on low heat. When oil is hot, pour egg liquid into the pot, stir-fry eggs until scattered and just cooked (solidified), then put back into the small bowl for later use.
+ Add a little more oil to the pot, turn on low heat. When pot is hot, pour the sliced fat pork into the pot to render pork lard.
+ When fat meat turns golden yellow, turn up heat to medium, put lean meat into the pot and stir-fry together.
+ When all lean meat changes color, add prepared ginger shreds, minced garlic, and Doubanjiang, stir-fry evenly to color the pork.
+ Put in green and red peppers, and the cooked eggs. Add soy sauce and white sugar. Continue to stir-fry until green peppers are slightly cooked (broken rawness), maintaining the crisp texture of green peppers.
+ Serve!

## Additional Content

+ If you put too much oil when stir-frying eggs for the first time, you may not need to add oil when stir-frying pork, depending on the situation.
