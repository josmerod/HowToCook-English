### First Fry to Set Shape

- Pour Vegetable Oil into pot, control oil amount according to pot size, oil level height above 3 cm.
- Heat on high heat until temperature reaches 150°, then turn to low heat to maintain temperature.
- Use chopsticks to pick up coated meat strips into oil pot, smooth into shape you like, fry for 3~5 minutes to set shape. Visually check color turning slightly yellow, feel slight hardness when flipping with spatula, then it is ready. Specific time depends on meat size, oil temperature, coating thickness.
- Dish out and drain oil.

tips: If you are not sure about time, you can fry a bit longer, otherwise meat will have a raw taste. If inexperienced, put into pot one by one to prevent sticking.

### Re-fry for Finished Product

- Raise oil temperature to 180°, put in first-fried meat strips, fry until golden yellow, then dish out.

## Additional Content

- Coating powder must be rubbed loose, don't have dry particles wrapped inside, otherwise it will explode!!!
- If there is too much meat to finish, you can fry only once and put in refrigerator. Take out and re-fry when eating later, texture is basically unaffected.
