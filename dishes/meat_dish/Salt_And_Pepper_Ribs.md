- Oil 10g

## Operation

- Wash pork chops, debone, smash with knife face to loosen, cut into thick slices, then cut into thick strips.
- Add Salt and Pepper Powder, mix well. Add Scallion Ginger Water **in batches** until gelatinous texture appears, put in refrigerator to marinate for 20 minutes.
- Make frying batter. Put 80g Flour, 20g Starch (Note: 20g Starch, reserve remaining 60g), 2-3g Custard Powder, 1g Salt.
- Crack in an egg, stir, then add 100g water in batches, then add 10g oil, stir repeatedly. Until batter is fully mixed and slightly sticky.
- Take out reserved 60g starch. Take out pork strips, coat with a layer of starch, then coat with batter.
- Add oil to pot, enough to cover ingredients, heat to about 150℃ - 160℃. Put in pork strips and fry until light golden yellow then fish out. Strips might stick when just put in, don't move them. Wait until fixed shape then use chopsticks to separate.
- Wait for oil temperature to rise to 150℃ - 160℃ again, put in pork strips to re-fry until golden yellow then fish out.
- Sprinkle Salt and Pepper Powder, mix evenly and serve.
