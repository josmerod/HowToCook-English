- Star Anise: 2 pieces
- Quail Egg (Optional, if no Quail Egg, can substitute with equal weight of Chicken Egg): 0-2
- Bean Curd Sheet (Optional): 0-80g
- Salt: 2-3g

## Operation

### Raw Material Preparation

- Cut `Pork Belly` into large blocks (About 4.5cm, better to cut if frozen for half an hour to one hour)
- Cut `Bean Curd Sheet` into 2cm width
- Cut `Ginger` into slices (Thickness about 3mm each)
- Boil `Water`
- Boil `Quail Egg` and prick holes with `Fork`/`Toothpick` (More holes better for flavor absorption)
- `Scallion` white part `Scallion White`

### Start Making

- Put cut `Pork Belly` into Cold Water pot, add Cooking Wine and Scallion Ginger, boil for 15 minutes to remove blood smell
- Put two slices of `Ginger` in pot to enhance flavor
- Turn on medium-low heat and directly add `Pork Belly`, no need to put cooking oil, fry all six sides of `Pork Belly` blocks, fry until oil comes out
- Pour out fried oil for later use, push `Pork Belly` to one side, add 15g `Rock Sugar`, stir-fry until `Rock Sugar` melts;
- After melting, fry Pork Belly with Rock Sugar until fused and colored, add
  - `Light Soy Sauce` 10ml
  - `Dark Soy Sauce` 15ml
  - `Cooking Wine` 5ml
  - Stir-fry until colored;
- Add `Boiled Water` to stew for 40 minutes (Students with poor knife skills who cut too large please consciously lengthen stewing time), and put in
  - `Ginger` 2 slices
  - `Fragrant Leaf` 3 leaves
  - `Star Anise` 2 pieces
- Cover pot lid and boil until boiling, add boiled and pricked `Quail Egg` and `Bean Curd Sheet`, turn on medium-low heat, wait for 40 minutes. (Can stir appropriately midway to prevent sticking to pot);
- Open pot lid, turn on high heat to reduce juice when soup juice is almost gone (Remember not to dry out);
- Add 2-3g `Salt`, stir-fry a bit, then can serve.
