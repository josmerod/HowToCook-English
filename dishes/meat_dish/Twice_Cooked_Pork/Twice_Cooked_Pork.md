## Operation

### Pork Belly Cooking - Stage 1

- Heat pot, press pork belly skin tightly against the pot to sear the skin.
  - This step is to deal with sweat glands on pig skin (Or ask the butcher to burn the skin when buying, if you like sweat glands you can ignore this).
- Brush skin clean with steel wool until black carbonized part is completely removed. If not brushed clean, it will taste bitter.
- Put pork belly into pot, put in cold water enough to submerge pork belly, put in ginger slices, cooking wine and scallion (take 2 scallions and tie knots).
- Boil on high heat. After boiling, skim off floating foam, continue boiling for 15 minutes, until lean meat part can be easily pierced with chopsticks.

### Side Dish Preparation

- Cut Green and Red Peppers into rings/circles.
- Cut Garlic Sprout into segments.
- Cut Ginger into small thin slices.
- Mix 5ml Doubanjiang and 5ml Light Soy Sauce in advance.

### Pork Belly Cooking - Stage 2

- Fish out cooked pork belly and put into cold water to cool.
- Dry the water on pork belly, cut into 2mm thin slices with fat on top and lean on bottom (If cut too thick, texture is bad and very oily).

### Start Stir-frying Meat

Note, this step **operation should be fast, be careful of burning the pot**.

1. Heat pot, put a layer of base oil to lubricate pot.
2. Put in pork belly and stir-fry until fat is transparent, meat slices slightly curled (commonly known as "Deng Zhan Wo" / Lamp Saucer Nest). "Er Dao Rou" gives best effect.
3. Pour in Doubanjiang and Soy Sauce mixture, 5g MSG, stir-fry for 15 seconds.
4. Put in Green and Red Pepper rings and small Ginger slices, put in another 5ml Doubanjiang, stir-fry for 30 seconds.
5. Put in Garlic Sprout, stir-fry for 60 seconds.
6. Serve.

### Simplified Version

- Use frozen pork belly placed at room temperature for 0.5 hour OR fresh pork belly refrigerated for 1 hour, cut into 2-5 mm thin slices.
- Turn on medium heat, dry-fry peppers in pot for 30-45 seconds then take out.
- Heat pot, put a layer of base oil to lubricate pot, put in ginger slices and stir-fry for 15 seconds.
- Pour in pork belly, stir-fry once every 10 seconds, wait until pork belly shows burnt yellow color (The longer you stir-fry, the harder the texture).
- Pour in previously dry-fried peppers, 10ml Doubanjiang, season with Light Soy Sauce, continue stir-frying for 60 seconds.
- Pour in Garlic Sprout segments stir-fry for 10 seconds.
- Serve.

## Additional Content

- If you don't like garlic sprouts, you can change to onion or other vegetables, but pay attention to the cooking time of vegetables, stir-fry vegetables in advance, otherwise vegetables might be half-raw.
- If pork belly block is large, cut into 5cm square blocks. Boil pork belly until chopsticks can be inserted into pig skin with slight force.
- Pork belly texture will be tighter after passing through cold water and cooling.
- Drying water on pork belly is to avoid oil splashing during stir-frying.
- Remember not to cut pork belly too thick, otherwise it will be very greasy.
