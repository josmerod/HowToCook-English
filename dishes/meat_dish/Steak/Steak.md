# Steak (Niu Pai)

![Steak Finished](./Steak.jpg)

Steak is a widely popular Western meat dish, rich in protein, fat, iron, zinc and other minerals. Steak cooking controls doneness through flexible cooking methods (pan-frying, grilling, slow cooking, aging), from medium rare (pink center) to well done. High temperature cooking creates a charred crust, combined with salt, garlic, butter, spices to get rich flavor. Steak cooking entry is relatively simple, but mastery is difficult. This article mainly introduces simplest pan-fried steak, total cooking time 15-30 minutes. Picture shows medium rare Short Ribs.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Pan (Cast iron skillet recommended if available)
- Aluminum Foil (Optional)
- Kitchen Paper (Optional)
- Spoon
- Steak, see [How to choose different types of steak](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/72352426)
- Olive Oil (Extra Virgin Olive Oil recommended)
- Butter
- Salt (Large grain Sea Salt recommended)
- Black Pepper Powder (Coarse grain fresh ground Black Pepper recommended)
- Garlic
- Spices (Optional, Rosemary or Thyme recommended, try to use fresh plant branches instead of powder)
- Prepared Steak Sauce (Optional)
- Side Dish (Optional, prepare according to preference, Recommend Asparagus, Button Mushroom, Cherry Tomato, Baby Potato, choose 1-2 kinds)

## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. One serving is exactly enough for 2 people.

Per serving:

- Steak: 450-500g (Two steaks)
- Black Pepper Powder: 2g
- Salt: 5g
- Garlic: 1 head (About 25-30g, actual usage about 5-10g)
- Olive Oil: 10-15ml
- Butter: 20-25g
- Button Mushroom: 5-10
- Baby Potato: 5-10 (About 20g each)
- Cherry Tomato: 5-10 (About 15g each)
- Thyme: 2g (If using fresh thyme branches, take 3-6 branches, about 10cm each)

## Operation

### Preparation

1. Thaw steak from refrigerator.
   - If steak is frozen, need to move to refrigerator one night in advance, and place at room temperature half an hour before cooking.
   - **Do NOT** place steak **in water or heat to thaw**.
2. Wash Cherry Tomato, Baby Potato and Button Mushroom, cut in half set aside.
3. Peel garlic, keep 5-8 large cloves, **smash** with knife back set aside.
4. Steak Pre-processing
   - For Ribeye Steak, use kitchen scissors to vertically insert into connective tissue at center of Ribeye, cut 1-2 cuts. This is because "eye" (connective tissue) of Ribeye will shrink violently at high temperature causing steak deformation and uneven heating.
   - For Sirloin Steak, if you don't like fat on edge, carefully remove with knife.
   - Then, wrap steak with kitchen paper, absorb all water attached to steak, until steak leaves no obvious water stain when lifted from cutting board.

### Cooking

Note: This process is suitable for making 2-3cm thick, medium to medium-well steak. If you like different doneness, consider increasing or decreasing first half frying time by 20-30%.

1. Turn stove to high heat, add olive oil to pan, heat pan for 15-30 seconds.
2. Marinate steak. Sprinkle Sea Salt and Black Pepper uniformly on all surfaces of steak and smear with hand, rub to embed salt and pepper particles into meat. Note, steak **needs to be put in pan immediately** after marinating, **advance marinating is not recommended**. This is because salt on surface will draw out moisture from beef, affecting cooking and losing flavor.
3. Heat pan to oil temperature 60-80% hot, put steak slowly into pan from near to far.
4. If using potato as side dish, put potato in bowl, heat in microwave for 10 minutes, or boil in boiling water for 3-5 minutes.
5. Fry one side for 1.5 minutes (This time applies to steak about 2-3cm thick. If thinner, shorten to 1 minute. If thicker, increase to 2-2.5 minutes.)
6. Flip, fry for another 1.5 minutes.
   - For Sirloin and Filet Mignon, use chopsticks or spatula to stand steak up to fry its side for about 30 seconds.
7. Switch stove to medium heat, then **quickly add** butter, garlic, thyme in order. Use spatula to push butter to smear quickly in pan until completely melted. Press garlic under steak to increase flavor.
8. **Tilt pan on stove**, so oil flows to one side.
9. Place spices and garlic on steak, use spoon to scoop oil in pan, continuously pour on steak. This process lasts 30 seconds, then flip steak, repeat for 30 seconds.
   - You can judge current heat by observing state of oil poured on steak surface. If oil bubbles on steak and color doesn't turn dark brown, temperature is appropriate.
   - If steak wasn't wiped dry or thawed in unrecommended way, or marinated with salt in advance, large amount of water will appear in pan, causing steak to be "boiled", losing flavor.
   - If large oil bubbles appear on steak surface and oil color turns dark brown, oil temperature is too high, remove pan from stove, wait a moment then continue pouring oil.
10. Dish out steak on cutting board, wrap with aluminum foil, wait 5-10 minutes. This process (Resting) uses steak's own temperature to continue heating and lock moisture.
11. Pour side dishes into pan, fry on medium heat for 5 minutes.
12. Take out steak, cut into 1.5cm wide strips, you can observe doneness of beef now.
13. Take out side dishes, plate, pour remaining oil in pan or steak sauce (Optionl).

### Heat Control

Frying steak is art of controlling heat. Briefly give some methods to quantitatively evaluate fire power and terms related to heat used in this article.

- For Induction Cooker:
  - High Fire: Power 1.8Kw - 2.2kw.
  - Medium Fire: Power 800w - 1.4kw.
  - Low Fire: Power 200w - 600w.
- For Gas Stove:
  - High Fire: Rotate gas valve to 70%-90% of max gas speed.
  - Medium Fire: Rotate gas valve to 40%-60% of max gas speed.
  - Low Fire: Rotate gas valve to 10%-30% of max gas speed.

### About Seasoning

Steak seasoning doesn't necessarily need to follow this guide. Generally, Garlic, Black Pepper and Butter are essential, but if you don't like taste of Lamiaceae plants like Rosemary or Thyme, you can freely try other steak seasonings. There are also various BBQ seasoning salts sold on market. I once found a Chinese-Western combined method, cutting Millet Chili and frying with garlic slices in olive oil, and pouring on steak at end as seasoning, also has unique flavor.
