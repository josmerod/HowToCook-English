## Additional Content

- Ensure soup added is warm when stewing
- Do not cover lid when stewing otherwise Potato will rot
- Flip from time to time when stewing to avoid burning bottom
- Casserole stewing will be more delicious, can stir-fry in wok then pour into boiling pot to stew, if using casserole do not use high heat before boiling to avoid cracking
