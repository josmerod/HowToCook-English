## Additional Content

- Chicken Leg deboning operation relatively complex, my experience for reference:
  - Place Chicken Leg upright on chopping board, **Bone facing programmer directly**, cut one knife from head to bottom, knife edge should be deep, ensure touching bone
  - Use hand to pull meat to two sides
  - Use knife tip to separate meat sticking on bone
  - Flip Chicken Leg, knife insert closely to bone, cut off connection point between bone and meat
  - Use knife tip to cut off last adhesion
