# Curry Beef (Ga Li Fei Niu)

![Curry Beef Finished](./Curry_Beef.jpg)

Curry Beef is delicious, nutritious, and appetizing. After eating too many stir-fried or deep-fried dishes, eating Curry Beef feels quite delightful.

It is suitable for eating at home or making into a bento to take to the office (microwaving won't produce too much smell~).

Moreover, it requires few ingredients, easy to buy, and beginners can generally finish cooking in 40 minutes.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Bay Leaf
- Pure Milk (Wei Gang Fresh Milk recommended)
- Onion
- Carrot
- Potato
- Beef Rolls (Fatty Beef / Fei Niu)
- Curry Block

## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. One serving is exactly enough for 2 people.

Per serving:

- Bay Leaf: 1 leaf
- Pure Milk: 50ml
- Onion: 100g
- Carrot: 150g
- Potato: 200g (Quite filling, add as appropriate)
- Beef Rolls: 300g (Add more if you like meat)
- Curry Block: 2 pieces (About 100g)

## Operation

- Cut onion into strips, carrot and potato into blocks, set aside.
- Boil a pot of water. When water boils, put beef rolls into the pot. Skim off blood foam then fish out and drain water, set aside.
- Heat pot, put 10ml - 15ml cooking oil into pot, **wait 10 seconds for oil temperature to rise**.
- Put in onion, stir-fry until onion becomes soft and transparent.
- Put in potato and carrot **stir-fry for 2 minutes**.
- Add cold water until it submerges all ingredients.
- Put bay leaf and curry block into pot, cover pot lid, **wait for water to boil then turn down heat and wait until potato blocks and carrot blocks are stewed soft and rotten (check with chopsticks)**.
- Add beef rolls and milk, cover pot lid and cook on low heat for another 2-3 minutes then serve (stir ingredients with spoon, pay attention to force to avoid breaking beef rolls).

## Additional Content

- Curry block does not need to be smashed, just put in the whole block.
- During operation, pay attention to stir ingredients to avoid uneven seasoning distribution.
