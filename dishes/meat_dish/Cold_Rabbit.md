## Additional Content

In Step 6 of operation, note: Oil amount should submerge rabbit meat. If not submerged, need to replenish in time.

In Step 7 of operation, note: Chili is extremely easy to burn. Burnt chili will turn black. This process is very fast, so must use low heat. Basically wait until there isn't much water vapor evaporating, then you can put in rabbit meat.
