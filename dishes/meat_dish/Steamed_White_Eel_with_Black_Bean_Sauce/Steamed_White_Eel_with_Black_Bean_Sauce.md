## Operation

1. **Check and Clean White Eel**:

   - Check White Eel after returning home, rinse clean, ensure no residual mucus or impurities.
   - Optional: Rub White Eel segments lightly with 3g Salt and 1 Tsp Cornstarch, marinate for 5 minutes then rinse clean, remove fishy smell and increase tenderness.

   - If like stronger fermented bean flavor, can add extra 0.5 Tbsp Fermented Black Beans.

3. **Plating**:
   - Spread cut White Eel segments flat in heat-resistant plate, try not to overlap.
   - Sprinkle Ginger shreds evenly on White Eel.
   - Pour mixed Black Bean Sauce evenly on White Eel.

4. **Steaming**:

## Additional Content

  - Can specify length when fishmonger cuts segments (About 5 cm is suitable), convenient for steaming and eating.
  - Steaming time should not be too long, to avoid White Eel meat becoming tough.

- **Variant Methods**:
  - Can add Chili or XO Sauce, increase spicy taste and layering.
  - If like softer tender texture, can add Rice Wine when marinating.
