Estimated Complexity: ★★

## Ingredients and Tools

* Tomato
* Eggs
* Cooking Oil
* Salt
* Sugar (Optional)
* Scallions (Optional)

## Calculations

Before cooking, determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is enough for 1 person.

**Total:**

* Tomato = 1 (approx. 180g) * servings
* Eggs = 1.5 * servings (round up)
* Cooking Oil = 4ml * number of eggs
* Salt = 1.5-2g * servings
* Sugar = 0-2g * servings
* Scallions = 0-10g * servings

## Steps

1. Wash the tomatoes.
2. **Optional**: Peel the tomatoes.
   - Scald the skin with boiling water, then place the tomato in cold water and peel off the skin.
3. Remove the stem of the tomato and cut it into small blocks with a side length of no more than 4cm. Let's call this `Tomato Blocks`.
4. Crack the eggs into a bowl, add `1g * servings` of salt, and whisk evenly. Let's call this `Egg Mixture`.
   - **Tip**: Consider adding 1ml of vinegar to the eggs; this can remove the fishy smell and make the eggs fluffier.
5. Heat the pan and add cooking oil.
6. Once the oil is hot, pour in the `Egg Mixture`. Scramble until the eggs solidify and turn slightly yellow. Let's call this `Semi-cooked Eggs`.
7. Turn off the heat. Remove the `Semi-cooked Eggs` and set aside. Restart the fire.
   - **Note**: Do not wash the pan.
8. Add the `Tomato Blocks` to the pan, press and stir-fry with a spatula for 20 seconds, or until the tomatoes are soft.
9. Add the `Semi-cooked Eggs` back into the pan and stir-fry evenly.
   - **Tip**: Consider adding 10ml of ketchup and 50ml of water to increase the sauce.
   - **Tip**: You can add other cooked meats or ingredients as desired.
10. Add the remaining salt, sugar (optional, if you prefer a sweeter version), and chopped scallions (optional). Stir-fry evenly.
11. Turn off the heat and serve.
