- Cut celery seedlings into 4cm celery segments, set aside.
- (Skip this step if using celery seedlings) Heat pot, pour boiling water from the kettle into the pot until water bubbles and boils.
- (Skip this step if using celery seedlings) Put the cut celery strips into the pot to blanch, put in celery leaves after about 20 seconds, turn off heat after 5 seconds, fish out all and pass through cold water, set aside.
- Sprinkle prepared salt, sesame oil, oyster sauce and Wei Ji Xian on the blanched celery or celery seedlings in the basin and mix evenly.
- Pour Tea Tree Mushrooms into the basin and mix evenly.
