## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Eggs
- Edible Salt

- Light Soy Sauce (Optional)

## Calculations

Based on portion for 1 person:

- Egg: 1
- Edible Salt: 1g
- Cooking Oil: 5ml
- Light Soy Sauce / Wei Ji Xian: 6ml (Optional seasoning)

## Operation

- Put one egg into a bowl and beat it.
- Add 60°C purified water 1.0-1.5 times the volume of the egg to the bowl, and mix evenly.
  - Less water in the correct range makes it more bouncy, more water makes it more tender.
  - Note: Beyond the range, less water will make texture too bouncy, more water will make it too dilute.
- Add 1g edible salt.
  - Salt plays an important role in adding base flavor and coagulation.
- Add 5ml cooking oil.
- Filter egg liquid to remove floating foam (Optional, but if not filtered, steamed eggs will have bubbles and look bad).
- Confirm water source of the steamer has been replenished to enough (if not sure, fill up the water tank).
- Put the completely mixed egg liquid bowl into the steamer.
- Adjust to **100°C** and steam for **10 minutes**.
- Open the steamer (Note: Steam will spray out instantly when opening the steamer, be careful to open slowly).
- Serve (Can add light soy sauce for seasoning).
- Enjoy.
