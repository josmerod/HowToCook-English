## Essential Ingredients and Tools

Maximum 3 portions can be made at a time. If more than 3 people need it, it needs to be made in multiple batches.

- Eggs
- Water

## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. One serving is exactly enough for 1 person to eat.

Totals:

- Eggs: 2 * Servings
- Water: 200ml * Servings
- Dried Shrimps (Xia Pi): 10 * Servings (Optional)
- Scallion: 5g * Servings (Optional)
- Salt: 3g * Servings
- Soy Sauce (Optional)
- Sesame Oil (Fragrant Oil): 1ml (Optional)

## Operation

- Break eggs into a ceramic bowl that can be heated in a microwave, use chopsticks to beat them.
- Add water and salt, mix evenly.
- Put dried shrimps into the bowl, mix evenly, ensure all dried shrimps do not pile up together.
- Chop scallion to 0.6±3mm size, put into bowl and mix evenly.
- Put this bowl and contents into the microwave, cover the container surface with cling film or a microwave-safe porcelain plate (Note: do not seal, must leave expansion space), heat for 2 minutes (500W).
- Carefully remove cling film or other covering, then continue to heat for 2 minutes.
- If the microwave does not have a rotating heating plate, rotate the bowl horizontally 180 degrees slowly to ensure contents are heated evenly.
- Put in sesame oil.
- Carefully take the bowl out of the microwave (really hot).
- If choosing to put in soy sauce, ensure soy sauce covers the egg custard surface in the thinnest form after flowing.
- Happily enjoy the egg custard.

## Additional Content

- 1 egg is about 50±5g. If using other varieties of eggs, adjust water amount proportionally.

- Make sure to beat the eggs, otherwise mild egg explosion may occur.

- Eggs and water should not exceed 2/3 of the bowl capacity, otherwise overflow may occur.
