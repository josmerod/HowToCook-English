Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Eggs
- Edible Salt
- Sesame Oil
- Light Soy Sauce / Wei Ji Xian
- White Vinegar (Optional)
- Rattan Pepper Oil (Optional)

## Calculations

Based on portion for 1 person:

- Eggs: 2
- Edible Salt: 3g
- Sesame Oil (or Fragrant Oil): 2-4ml
- Light Soy Sauce / Wei Ji Xian: 8ml
- White Vinegar (or Cooking Wine): 2ml (Optional)

## Operation

- Break two eggs into a bowl and beat them.
- Add 3g edible salt.
  - Salt plays an important role in adding base flavor and coagulation.
- Add 2ml white vinegar to remove the fishy smell of eggs (Optional).
  - Adding rice vinegar is also fine, but the color of rice vinegar will make the eggs slightly black.
  - You can also add cooking wine, which also has the effect of removing fishy smell and has no sour taste of vinegar.
- Add 70°C purified water, 1-1.5 times the volume of eggs, to the bowl and mix evenly.
  - 1 time water makes eggs more bouncy, 1.5 times water makes eggs more tender.
- Filter the egg liquid to remove floating foam (Optional, but if not filtered, the steamed eggs will have bubbles and look bad).
- Add 50ml clear water to any pot. After water boils, put in the bowl with egg liquid.
  - The steaming bowl should be covered with a lid, an inverted iron plate with grooves, or cling film to reduce water vapor entry, this is to avoid it becoming honeycomb-shaped.
- Steaming steps (Choose one of two):
  1. Steam on **medium heat** for **10 minutes**, turn off heat after 10 minutes and simmer for another **5 minutes**.
  2. Steam on **high heat** for **5 minutes**, keep the water in the pot boiling, otherwise extend the time. Open the lid once every **2 minutes** to release water vapor. If opening lid too late, egg custard tends to become honeycomb-shaped; if opening too early/frequently, steaming time needs to be longer.
- How to judge if it is cooked?
  - Shake the bowl, if the egg custard is no longer in liquid state and has a jelly-like bouncy state, it can be served.
- Serve.
- Add sesame oil and light soy sauce to enjoy.
  - You can also use Rattan Pepper Oil (Teng Jiao You) instead of sesame oil to add a numbing and refreshing taste.
