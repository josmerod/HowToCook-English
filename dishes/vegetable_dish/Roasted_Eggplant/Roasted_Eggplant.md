Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Eggplant
- Cooking Oil
- Soy Sauce (Light Soy Sauce)
- Minced Garlic
- Chili/Pepper
- Cumin
- Edible Salt

## Calculations

Based on portion for two people:

- Eggplant: 1 (About 200g)
- Cooking Oil: 20-30 ml
- Soy Sauce: 4-6 g
- Millet Chili: 1 (About 20g)
- Minced Garlic: 3-4 cloves
- Cumin: 1-3 g
- Edible Salt: 0.5-2 g

## Operation

- Put soy sauce, cumin, edible salt, minced garlic and chopped millet chili in a bowl, stir evenly for later use.
- Wash the eggplant, wipe dry the moisture on the surface with a paper towel.
- Pierce the eggplant 4-8 times on one side with a fork.
- Use 15-25ml cooking oil to coat the entire surface of the eggplant.
- Set the oven temperature to 200℃ (Turn on oven fan, high heat), preheat for 2 minutes.
- Put the eggplant in the middle or upper layer of the oven, roast for 12-15 minutes (Eggplant surface should be wrinkled, and can be pressed 0.3-0.5cm deep).
- Take out the eggplant, use a knife to make a vertical cut on the eggplant. The cut should be centered, 1-1.5cm away from top and bottom.
- Use a small knife or fork to reach into the cut and cut the inside of the eggplant vertically.
- Pry the cut open slightly, pour in the sauce prepared in the first step.
- Put the eggplant into the oven again, set the oven temperature to 200℃, roast for 4-7 minutes.
- Take out, turn off the oven power.

## Additional Content

The final product is almost the same as the roasted eggplant at the barbecue stall downstairs, too fragrant!

**Precautions:**
Moisture on the surface of the eggplant, not fully coated with cooking oil, or not pierced with a fork may cause **the eggplant to explode during the roasting process**.

**Areas for Improvement:**
When making the cut with a knife for the first time, you can directly cut the eggplant vertically into two halves, then cut textures and smear sauce.
