## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Eggplant

- Chili/Pepper (Green Pepper, **NOT chili powder or chili oil**)
- Soy Sauce

## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. One serving is enough for 2-3 people.

Totals:

- Eggplant Quantity = Servings * 1 (Each eggplant about 150g)
- Potato Quantity = Servings * 1 (Each potato about 150g)
- Meat Quantity = Servings * 180 g
- Soy Sauce Quantity = Servings * 15 ml
- Salt Quantity = Servings * 5 g
- Chili Quantity = 50 g (Seasoning, so put this amount regardless of people)
- Garlic Quantity = 3 cloves (Seasoning, so put this amount regardless of people. Note it is 3 cloves, **NOT 3 whole heads**)

## Operation

1. Wash eggplant, potato, chili. Peel garlic and crush it.
2. Cut eggplant and potato into blocks of about 6 cubic cm, cut chili into 5g small pieces, cut meat into 3cm shreds.
3. Turn on the fire, heat the pot, add Servings * 13 ml oil.
4. When you see a wisp of smoke from the oil in the pot, put in the chili.
5. After frying out the chili fragrance, immediately put in the meat and stir-fry with a spatula for 30 seconds.
6. Put in the potato, stir-fry for 30 seconds.
7. Put in the eggplant, stir-fry for 30 seconds.
8. Put in soy sauce and salt, continue to stir-fry for 5 minutes.
9. Add water, the water level height should be 0.9 times the height of ingredients in the pot, and cover the pot lid.
10. Wait until the water level in the pot remains 0.1 times the height of ingredients, open the lid, put in garlic, stir evenly, turn off the fire.

## Additional Content

In steps 5-7 of the operation, pay attention: during this process, if there is no liquid (oil or water) at the bottom of the pot, add 5 ml of water and continue to stir-fry.
