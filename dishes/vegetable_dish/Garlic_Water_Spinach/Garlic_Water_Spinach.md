# Garlic Water Spinach

Background:

I once ate Garlic Water Spinach (Hollow Heart Vegetable / Ong Choy) at a Sichuan restaurant near my school, and I have loved it ever since.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Water Spinach
* Minced Garlic
* Salt
* Light Soy Sauce
* Chopsticks
* Spatula

## Calculations

Per serving:

* Fresh Water Spinach: 250 g
* Garlic: Half a head, chopped into minced garlic
* Cooking Oil: 45 ml
* Salt: 2 g
* White Sugar: 3 g
* Light Soy Sauce: 8 ml

## Operation

* Wash Water Spinach, remove rotten leaves or old stems, cut evenly into 2 or 3 sections (to prevent being too long and hard to fry).
* Pour a small amount of oil into the pot first, heat until slightly smoking. At this time, pick up the pot and swirl the hot oil around to coat the pot bottom evenly, then pour in the remaining oil ([Hot Pot Cold Oil Method](https://cook.aiursoft.com/tips/learn/%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E7%82%92%E4%B8%8E%E7%85%8E/?h=%E7%83%AD%E9%94%85#_5)).
* Put in minced garlic, fry on low heat for 10 to 15 seconds to bring out fragrance.
* Put in Water Spinach evenly and quickly, **turn to high heat**. Hold spatula in left hand and chopsticks in right hand, coordinate to flip Water Spinach constantly, **until softened and turns green**.
* Then no need to use chopsticks, use spatula to quickly stir-fry the softened Water Spinach for 15-20 seconds to heat evenly. Sprinkle in 2g salt, 3g white sugar, 8ml light soy sauce.
* Continue to stir-fry on high heat for 10 seconds, serve.

## Additional Content

* Try to choose fresh, tender Water Spinach, otherwise the taste might be tough after frying.
* The actual amount of Water Spinach can be decided according to the size of the pot. It is recommended not to exceed one pot, otherwise if it's too much, it's easy to drop some Water Spinach onto the stove during the initial flipping and subsequent stir-frying.
* When frying Water Spinach, must **use high heat**, so that Water Spinach can soften quickly while maintaining crisp and tender texture. High heat also helps to bring out the fragrance of soy sauce.
