- Cut each cooked egg along the short axis into 4 slices of similar volume.
- If you plan to coat with starch, coat each egg slice with starch, shake off excess starch.
- Put 25 ml oil in the pot (if not coating with starch, put 20 ml), put in cooked egg slices.
- Fry until slightly scorched/golden yellow, add 10 ml oil (if not coating with starch, add 10 ml), flip.
- After the second side is slightly yellow, add line pepper, millet chili, minced garlic and fry for about one minute, flip.
- Then add bean paste and fry for about dozens of seconds, flip.
- Mix light soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar into a sauce, pour in, shake the pot gently and serve.
