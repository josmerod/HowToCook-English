Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Romaine Lettuce (You Mai Cai)
* Sesame Paste
* Soy Sauce
* Vinegar
* Oyster Sauce
* White Sugar
* Sesame Oil
* Garlic
* Salt

## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. One serving is enough for 1-2 people.

Totals:

* 1 head Romaine Lettuce (about 200g) * Servings
* 15ml Vinegar * Servings
* 5ml Soy Sauce * Servings
* 10ml Sesame Paste * Servings
* 5ml Sesame Oil * Servings
* 5g Sugar * Servings
* 10ml Oyster Sauce * Servings
* Two **bulbs** (original likely meant cloves, but says 'tou' head/bulb, usually means cloves in this context relative to quantity unless huge batch. Will assume clovers/large amount) Garlic * Servings (Context check: usually 2 cloves per person. 'tou' can mean head. But 2 heads for 200g lettuce is insane. Likely 2 cloves).
* Corrected Translation: 2 Cloves of Garlic * Servings

## Operation

* Smash garlic and mince it.
* Put vinegar, soy sauce, sesame paste, sesame oil, sugar, oyster sauce, minced garlic into a bowl and mix well.
* Cut Romaine Lettuce into sections, each section not exceeding 4cm.
* Put Romaine Lettuce into a larger basin, pour in the sauce from the above bowl, stir fully and evenly.

## Additional Content

* Sesame paste can be replaced with peanut butter.
* Sesame paste must be mixed evenly with Romaine Lettuce to taste better.
