# Stir-fried Eggplant

Home-style Stir-fried Eggplant is simple and easy to learn. The ingredients are not complex, and some optional items can be omitted. (But Star Anise is strongly recommended).

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Eggplant
- Star Anise (Optional)
- Dried Shrimp (Optional)
- Scallion (Optional)
- Minced Meat (Optional)
- Soy Sauce
- Sugar (Optional)
- Vinegar (Optional)
- Rapeseed Oil or Peanut Oil

## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. One serving is enough for 1-2 people.

Totals:

- Eggplant Quantity = Servings * 1.8 pieces
- Star Anise = Servings * 1 piece
- Dried Shrimp = Servings * Half a handful (normal male hand)
- Scallion = Servings * 2 stalks
- Minced Meat = Servings * 50 g
- Soy Sauce = Servings * 40 ml
- Sugar = Servings * 5 g
- Vinegar = Servings * 10 ml

> Note: Oil and Soy Sauce are also mentioned in the operation, you can cross-check to determine the quantity of added ingredients.

## Operation

- Wash the eggplant clean, cut into two sections (vertically) with one knife. Cut each section into diamond-shaped blocks. Put the cut eggplant into a bowl for standby.
- Wash the scallion clean, cut into chopped green onion and put on the cutting board for standby.
- Cut the star anise and put on the cutting board for standby.
- If you plan to add minced meat, first stir-fry it in 10 ml oil (15 ml if lean meat) over medium heat until it changes color (about 1 minute), then remove and set aside.
- Turn on the fire to heat the pot/wok until there is no water in it.
- Pour cooking oil into the pot, covering the bottom of the pot twice (oil can be more, but not less).
- When the oil is about 60% hot/ripe, put in the three optional ingredients: star anise, dried shrimp, and scallion.
- If there are no optional ingredients like star anise, heat the oil to 90% hot.
- When the oil in the pot reaches 90% hot, pour the eggplant from the bowl into the pot and stir-fry with a spatula.
- Stir-fry for about 40 seconds, then hold the spatula in the air parallel to the pot, and pour soy sauce into the spatula. About 2.5 spatulas per person (soy sauce can be less, but not more, or it will be salty).
- When the eggplant is half soft (after about 1 minute), put back the pre-fried minced meat and stir evenly quickly.
- If you plan to add sugar and vinegar, add them now.
- Continue to stir-fry.
- When all the eggplant in the pot changes color and becomes soft, fish it out.

## Additional Content

- Due to the soy sauce, this dish does not need added salt. You can taste it before serving. If it is not salty enough, you can add a tiny amount of salt. Next time, increase the amount of soy sauce.
- If dried shrimp is added, the amount of soy sauce can be reduced appropriately.
- When frying this dish, keep high heat throughout.
- Taboo! Do not add water, it will become boiled eggplant and the texture will be poor. So add more oil, not less.
- If the household stove temperature does not rise significantly after reaching 70% oil temperature, you can proceed directly to the next step without forcing 90% oil temperature.
- Add sugar and vinegar at the final stage, stir-fry for 20 seconds and remove from the pan to avoid adding vinegar too early, otherwise the sour taste will evaporate.
