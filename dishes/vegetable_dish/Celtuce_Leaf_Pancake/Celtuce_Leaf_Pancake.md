## Additional Content

* Choosing Celtuce leaves is because vegetable packages bought in some provinces/cities basically include Celtuce. You can replace it with leeks, etc.
* Celtuce leaves have a bitter taste if blanched directly and eaten cold, so choosing to make them into a side dish for pancakes is a good choice.
