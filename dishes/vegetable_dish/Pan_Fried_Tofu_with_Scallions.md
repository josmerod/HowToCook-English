# Pan-fried Tofu with Scallions

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- White Tofu
- Scallion
- Green Chili Pepper
- Salt
- Chicken Essence (Jijing)
- Flat-bottomed Pan

## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. One serving is enough for 1 person.

Totals:

- Quantity of White Tofu = Servings * 0.8 (Round up)
- Quantity of Chili = 1.5 pieces / 3 people
- Quantity of Scallion = 2 stalks / 3 people
- Amount of Salt = Servings * 3g
- Amount of Chicken Essence = Servings * 1.5g

Use the above conditions to calculate the proportion of raw materials planned to be used, and adjust according to taste.

## Operation

* Wash the tofu clean. Cut into thickness of about 5 mm, place in a dish.
* Wash the scallion clean, remove roots, cut into chopped green onion, set aside.
* Wash the chili clean, cut open, remove seeds, cut into 1cm * 1cm shapes, set aside.
* Heat the pan, add Servings * 9ml oil.
* After the oil enters the pan, make it evenly distributed on the bottom of the pan. Put in the tofu evenly, pan-fry over low heat until golden yellow, then flip.
* Wait until both sides are golden yellow, serve onto a plate for later use.
* Replenish oil to cover the bottom of the pan, pour in chili and stir-fry over high heat, and crush with spatula for 3 minutes.
* Pour in the tofu, stir-fry, add salt and chicken essence, stir-fry over medium heat for 1 minute, then pour in 10 ML water, collect the juice (reduce sauce) over high heat.
* Sprinkle with the calculated chopped green onions before removing from the pan, serve on a plate.
