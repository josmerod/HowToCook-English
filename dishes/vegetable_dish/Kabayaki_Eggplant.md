Use Kabayaki sauce to cook eggplant.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Eggplant
- Kabayaki Sauce (Eel Sauce) ingredients
- Honey
- White Sugar
- Light Soy Sauce
- Dark Soy Sauce
- Cooking Wine
- Water

## Calculations

- Decide the amount of oil according to the type of pot
  - Non-stick pan: After oil gathers into drops, it should be spread over the area of the eggplant
  - Iron pan: Oil can just cover the bottom of the pan after spreading
- 1 long eggplant (top small bottom big) (Note: do not use Zhejiang eggplant or round eggplant)
- 1 portion of Kabayaki Sauce
  - 20 ml Honey
  - 15 ml White Sugar
  - 40 ml Light Soy Sauce
  - 10 ml Dark Soy Sauce
  - 20 ml Cooking Wine
  - 100 ml Water

## Operation

- Peel the eggplant, cut transversely into two sections
- Steam for 5 minutes
- Cut longitudinally, do not cut through, make 2~3 cuts on the cut surface on both sides until it can be flattened
- Fry until both sides are golden yellow
- Pour Kabayaki sauce on the eggplant until it covers 1/2 of the eggplant height
- Fry until the back side is colored, flip
  - Reduce the sauce at the same time. If unable to reduce, you can add water starch (ratio of raw starch to water is 1:4 to 1:10 depending on the reduction situation)
- Pour the remaining Kabayaki sauce on the eggplant
- Serve, a portion of Eggplant Kabayaki is ready

## Additional Content

- This Kabayaki is actually very Chinese style, Japanese Kabayaki is actually grilled.
- The soul lies in the Kabayaki sauce? You can also buy ready-made Kabayaki sauce.
- If you feel it is greasy, you can sprinkle some small chopped green onions of 2~5 mm after plating, and the color matching can be less monotonous.
- For stir-fried eggplant (Fish-fragrant Eggplant, Sauce-exploded Eggplant), I strongly recommend Zhejiang eggplant. It is slender so cutting into rolling blocks is just right, the skin is very tender unlike here where it implies needing peeling, and the eggplant taste is moderate.
