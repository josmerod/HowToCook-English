Blanched Choy Sum is a classic Cantonese dish. "Bai Zhuo" (Blanching) is a cooking technique in Cantonese cuisine, which uses boiling water or soup to scald raw food until cooked. This cooking method can maintain the original fresh taste and is often used in Cantonese cuisine to cook shrimp and vegetables.

In short, it is an **excellent way to lose weight or quickly deal with green leafy vegetables**.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Fresh Choy Sum (Flowering Chinese Cabbage)
- Light Soy Sauce, Oyster Sauce, Salt
- Garlic, Millet Chili (Bird's Eye Chili)
- Cooking Oil

## Calculations

The following amounts are enough for two people, or for one person to eat directly with rice.

- Fresh Choy Sum: 250g
- Cooking Oil: 10g
- Mix a "Soul Sauce":
  - Light Soy Sauce: 5g
  - Oyster Sauce: 5g
  - Salt, Sugar: 5g
- Garlic: 4-5 cloves, Millet Chili: 1-2 pieces

## Operation

1. Wash the Choy Sum clean, **remove the hard or old parts of the roots**. Here, I also used a knife to **scrape the root stems of the Choy Sum** to remove the hard outer layer. The inside of the Choy Sum is more palatable, but pay attention to the blanching time of the stems; if it is too long, the stems will not be crisp.

2. Mince the garlic. If you have onions, you can add some onions.

3. Make the Soul Sauce: Mix 5g Light Soy Sauce, 5g Oyster Sauce, add 3g Sugar and 100g clear water (half a bowl) to make a bowl of sauce.
   > If you add starch, the sauce will hang on the Choy Sum more easily after boiling, and the taste will be heavier. Cantonese people might not be used to it.

4. Boil 500ml clear water in a pot, add 5g salt and 10g cooking oil.

5. Blanch the Choy Sum stems in boiling water for 1 minute until the stem color turns dark green. Then put the whole Choy Sum into the pot and blanch for 1 minute. Fish them up and arrange them on a plate.

6. Use another small pot to pour in the mixed sauce, bring to a boil over low heat, add half of the minced garlic, a little shredded ginger, and chopped millet chili. When making it, I added a little chopped onion and garlic. First pour oil into the bottom of the pot, add minced garlic and onion when 50% hot, sauté slightly until fragrant, then add the sauce, add millet chili and bring to a boil.

7. Let the sauce reduce slightly. After boiling, wait for ten seconds or so, then pour directly over the Choy Sum. Not too much, but the minced garlic is very powerful, don't skimp on garlic.
