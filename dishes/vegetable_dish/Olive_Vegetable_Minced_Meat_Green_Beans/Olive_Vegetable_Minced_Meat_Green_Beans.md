Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Green Beans (String Beans / Four Season Beans)
* Pork Belly
* Olive Vegetable (Preserved vegetable with olives)
* Garlic
* Millet Chili (Optional if you don't eat spicy)

## Calculations

* Green Beans: 220g
* Pork Belly: 100g
* Olive Vegetable: 20g
* Garlic: 10g
* Millet Chili: 10g

## Operation

* Wash the Green Beans, tear off the strings cleanly, then cut into granules of uniform size for later use.
* Smash garlic and mince into garlic puree for later use.
* Cut Millet Chili into granules of uniform size for later use.
* Remove skin from Pork Belly, then mince into meat mince for later use.
* Heat the pot/wok, then add 20ml oil to lubricate the pot (Hua Guo - swirl oil to coat). After lubricating, pour out the hot oil, then add 10ml cold oil. This is the legendary "Hot Pot Cold Oil", mainly to prevent meat mince from sticking to the pot.
* If you don't have an oil drying bottle at home, you can skip lubricating the pot. After putting in oil, add meat mince directly and start stir-frying. Stir-fry over low heat for two minutes to fry out the lard/pork fat.
* After the meat mince is fragrant, add minced garlic, Olive Vegetable and Millet Chili, stir-fry until fragrant.
* Add Green Beans and stir-fry over medium heat. Green Beans must be stir-fried for at least 5 minutes. Make sure the Green Beans are **cooked through**, otherwise it may cause food poisoning.
* After the Green Beans are cooked, add 2ml soy sauce directly from the edge of the pot, then add 2g salt, 1g chicken essence, 1g pepper powder and 0.5g sugar.
* Stir-fry the seasonings evenly.
* Serve, plate.
