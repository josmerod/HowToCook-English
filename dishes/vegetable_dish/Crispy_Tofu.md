## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Firm Tofu (Old Tofu)
- Eggs
- Light Soy Sauce
- Dark Soy Sauce
- Oyster Sauce
- White Sugar
- Corn Starch
- Flat-bottomed Pan

## Calculations

Per serving:

- Firm Tofu: 1 block (Market buy 1.25 squares * person)
- Eggs: 2 * Tofu blocks
- Corn Starch: 50 g * Tofu blocks
- Light Soy Sauce: 20 g
- Oyster Sauce: 10 g
- Dark Soy Sauce: 5 g
- White Sugar: 10 g

## Operation

- Beat eggs to form egg liquid and set aside.
- Configure sauce (20 g Light Soy Sauce + 10 g Oyster Sauce + 5 g Dark Soy Sauce + 10 g White Sugar + 10 g Corn Starch + 200 ml Clear Water).
- Cut firm tofu into slices (Personal suggestion, for reference only: Person * 5 slices, thickness 1.2 cm).
- Pour corn starch into a plate, coat the tofu slices with starch, then coat with egg liquid, place aside.
- Heat the pan, put 18ml cooking oil into the pan. Wait 10 seconds for the oil temperature to rise.
- Put the tofu slices coated with egg liquid evenly into the pan, covering the bottom. Pan-fry over low heat until golden yellow, then flip.
- After both sides are fried to golden yellow, pour in the sauce, let each piece of tofu be bathed in the sauce, cook over high heat for 3 minutes until the sauce is thick.
- Turn off the heat.
