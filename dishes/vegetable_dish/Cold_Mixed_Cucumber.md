## Additional Content

* In some cases, the ends of the cucumber have a bitter taste, please verify after washing and cutting.
* Eat directly after making, or put it in the refrigerator to chill (not freeze) before eating.
* If put in the refrigerator, wrap tightly with plastic wrap/cling film, and finish eating within 8 hours, otherwise the cucumber will lose its crisp texture due to excessive marinating.
* Recommended to peel cucumber, taste is better.
