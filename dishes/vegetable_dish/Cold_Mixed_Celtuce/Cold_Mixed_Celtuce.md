## Additional Content

* Radish is not mandatory, just to increase the color of the dish.
* After serving, you can add extra condiments such as light soy sauce, white sugar, balsamic vinegar, sesame seeds, etc., according to personal taste.
* The size of the Celtuce strips is decided by personal taste, but peel the Celtuce skin as much as possible, otherwise it really affects the texture.
