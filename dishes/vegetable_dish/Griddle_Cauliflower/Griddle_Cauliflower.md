## Essential Ingredients and Tools

## Calculations

Per serving:

- Cauliflower: 400 g
- Pork Belly: 100 g
- Chili Pepper: 1-2 pieces
- Light Soy Sauce: 10 ml
- White Sugar: 5 g
- Garlic Cloves: 3-4
- Salt: 2 g

## Operation

- Face the cauliflower flower-side down and soak in light salt water for 20 minutes. Then wash and use a small knife to break into small florets.
- Blanch in boiling water for 1 minute, fish out and immediately rinse with cold water until completely cool, drain water for later use.
- Cut pork belly into thin slices, slice the white part of the garlic (or leek/scallion white) flat with the back of a knife, and cut small red chili peppers into sections.
- Heat the pot and put in oil. When the oil is hot, add the scallion whites to burst out the aroma.
- Put the pork belly slices into the pot, stir-fry over medium heat until the surface basically changes color, continue to stir-fry for a while to force out some of the fat from the fatty meat.
- Pour in the red chili sections and cauliflower, stir-fry a few times.
- Add 10 ml Light Soy Sauce.
- Add 5 g White Sugar, turn to high heat and stir-fry constantly for 1 minute.
- Cut the garlic leaves (or green part) into sections, put them into the pot, stir-fry for a few times, turn off the heat, cover the lid and simmer for 1 minute.
