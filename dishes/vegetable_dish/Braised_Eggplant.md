- Salt
- Soy Sauce

## Calculations

Determine how many servings you plan to make before cooking. One serving is enough for 2 people.

Totals:

- Quantity of Green Eggplant = Servings * 0.7
- Green Chili Pepper = Servings * 0.5
- Onion = Servings * 0.3
- Tomato = 1
- Scallion = 1/2 stalk
- Garlic = 3 cloves
- Eggs = 1
- Flour = Eggplant quantity * 150 g
- Starch = Flour / 4 g
- Soy Sauce = Eggplant quantity * 7 g (Round up)

## Operation

1. Wash Green Eggplant, Green Chili Pepper, Tomato, Onion, and Scallion.
2. Cut Scallion into 5 mm wide chopped green onions, peel and crush Garlic, cut Tomato into 6 cubic centimeter blocks, cut Green Chili Pepper and Onion into 5g pieces.
3. Cut Eggplant into diamond-shaped blocks (first cut 2 cm thick slices, then cut slices into 2 cm strips, finally cut blocks diagonally...).
4. Pour flour into a basin, add a small amount of water in turn, stir evenly to form a sticky paste.
5. Add starch, add 30 g water, stir evenly.
6. Crack egg into the basin, add (Flour / 20) g of salt, stir evenly.
7. Pour eggplant blocks into the batter, stir to ensure every side of the eggplant blocks is coated with batter.
8. Turn on high heat, heat the pot, add 500 ml of oil. When you can see a wisp of smoke rising from the oil in the pot, turn to low heat, put the eggplant blocks into the oil pot with chopsticks. After all eggplant blocks are in the pot, turn to medium heat, fish out when the eggplant blocks turn golden yellow, and pour out the oil.
9. Add (Servings * 5) g of oil, put in Garlic, Scallion, stir-fry for 15 seconds, put in Green Chili Pepper blocks stir-fry for 30 seconds, put in Tomato stir-fry for 30 seconds.
10. Put in fried eggplant blocks, add water to a height of 0.8 times the ingredients in the pot.
11. Add Soy Sauce and (Servings * 3) g of salt.
12. Wait until the soup is thick (water level is about 0.2-0.3 times the height of the remaining ingredients), open the lid, serve the dish, turn off the heat.
