## Additional Content

Based on following reasons, need to add Pork Belly in Braised Carp:

- Pork Belly produces lard when stir-fried, compared to vegetable oil, animal fat is more fragrant.
- Fried golden Pork Belly also tastes very fragrant after stewing, equivalent to side dish.
- Fish itself has less fat content, so lacks fragrance, focuses on texture of meat. So generally doing fish dishes suggest using lard, want a pot of milky white fragrant rich fish soup. Lard is best choice~
