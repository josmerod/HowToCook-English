## Additional Content

- Technical Summary:
  - This dish belongs to "have hand can do", key point lies in heat, size of fish is related to heat, too long will cause fish meat too old extremely affecting texture, too short will cause part of fish meat not cooked. So high heat steaming fish generally within 10 minutes is better.
  - Remember steaming fish need to use chopsticks to separate dish holding fish, benefits of doing this have two points:
    - 1. Fish during steaming process will drip water to plate, if fish directly contacts will cause fish fishy when eating.
    - 2. Can let fish heat evenly.
  - Difficulty coefficient of this dish simple, and taste very great oh.
