## Calculations

* Garlic Cloves: 3-4 cloves, smashed or chopped or sliced
* Dried Chili: (According to personal taste) 2-3, chopped
* Coriander: According to personal taste
* Salt: 10g, if chili is very spicy, suggest a bit more
* Vinegar: 5ml
* Soy Sauce: 5ml
* White Sugar: 10g
* Scallion: 1-2 stalks, normally sprinkle chopped scallion
* Millet Chili: 1-2, can distinct, experienced advice, at most 2, otherwise too spicy hurts anus.
* MSG: Depending on personal taste, do not put too much, 5g is enough.
* Oyster Sauce: 5g is enough, same logic as MSG.
