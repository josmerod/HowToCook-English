Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Sugar (choose one):
  - Rock Sugar: Produces the most vibrant, bright red color. Must be "water-oil" fried; it melts very slowly without water.
  - White Granulated Sugar: Must be "water-oil" fried.
  - Soft White Sugar: Can be fried without adding water.
- **Important**: Do not use excessively high heat! Induction cookers may lack fine control; overcooking leads to bitterness, while undercooking remains too sweet.

## Calculations

- Oil: 100ml
- Boiling Water: 500ml
- Sugar (using Rock Sugar as an example)

## Operation

- Turn on the heat and pour 100ml of boiling water into the pan.
- Immediately pour in 100ml of oil. The interval should be as short as possible. Use medium-high heat at this stage.
- Add the rock sugar (crush it beforehand if the pieces are too large).
- Adjust heat to medium.
- **Stir Constantly**:
  - Keep stirring until the mixture turns brownish-tan, then **turn to low heat**.
  - The mixture will thin out and turn the color of black tea, then deep soy-red. Small bubbles will begin to form.
  - The small bubbles will gradually disappear, followed by the appearance of large bubbles. When the large bubbles appear, the caramel coloring is complete.
  - **Quick Action Required**: You must proceed immediately to stop the cooking (otherwise it will turn bitter). Choose one of the following:
    - **Step 1**: Directly add 400ml of boiling water to lower the temperature and stop the process.
    - **Step 2**: Add aromatics like scallions, ginger, garlic, or peppercorns and proceed with stir-frying your main ingredients.
