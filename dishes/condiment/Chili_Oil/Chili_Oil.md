## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Garlic cloves
- Dried Chili Flakes/Powder
- Salt
- Toasted White Sesame Seeds
- Bird's Eye Chili (Millet Chili)
- Peanut Oil (can be replaced with Rapeseed Oil)
- Small Ceramic Bowl
- Iron Spoon
- Five-Spice Powder (Optional)
- Cao Guo (Black Cardamom, Optional)
- Scallion (Optional)
- Star Anise
- Sichuan Peppercorns
- Bay Leaves
- Bai Zhi (Angelica dahurica)
- Ginger Slices (Optional)
- Sugar
- White Vinegar

## Calculations

- 1 Garlic head
- Dried Chili Flakes 100g
- Salt 5g
- Toasted White Sesame Seeds 15g
- 1 Bird's Eye Chili
- Peanut Oil 150ml
- Five-Spice Powder 10g (Optional)
- 1 Cao Guo (Optional)
- 3-5 Scallions (Optional)
- Other spices: 1 Star Anise, 20-50 Sichuan Peppercorns (to taste), 2-3 Bay Leaves, 2-3 slices of Bai Zhi, ginger slices (Optional)
- Sugar 30g
- White Vinegar 5ml (approx. one small iron spoonful)

## Operation

- Peel and mince two cloves of garlic.
- Mince the bird's eye chili.
- Heat the peanut oil in a pan. Add the scallions and "Other spices" (star anise, peppercorns, etc.). Fry until the spices turn dark/charred, then remove and discard them.
- Continue heating the oil for about 2 minutes (if using rapeseed oil, heat until it smokes).
- In a clean ceramic bowl, combine the dried chili flakes, sesame seeds, minced garlic, minced chili, salt, five-spice powder, and cao guo.
- Turn off the heat and let the oil cool to approximately **210°C**.
- Pour the hot oil into the bowl of spices and stir immediately with a spoon. (Optional: You can add extra chili flakes halfway through when the oil reaches 165°C for extra spice).
- After pouring and stirring, add the white vinegar; the mixture will bubble up. Stir well—the vinegar enhances the aroma.
- Once the chili oil has cooled to a warm temperature, add the sugar and MSG (if using). The sugar mellows the heat and makes the flavor less harsh.

## Additional Content

- Adding five-spice powder and cao guo as part of the spice mix significantly increases the depth of aroma.
