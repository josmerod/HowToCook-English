Scientist developed circulating boiling method, can simultaneously achieve dense egg yolk, evenly solidified egg white and retain most nutrients effect. Need precise control temperature and time, difficulty relatively high.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Fresh Egg (Recommend Grade AA)
- 100°C Boiling Water Pot (Diameter ≥ 15cm)
