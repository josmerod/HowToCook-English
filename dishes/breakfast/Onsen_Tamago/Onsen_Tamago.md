### Remarks

- If use mechanical thermometer (no need power supply) then thermometer probe needs to submerge into water at least 6cm, if use electronic thermometer then no special requirement
- Pot can use slightly thick pot, convenient to control temperature
- Although 70 Degrees Celsius 25 Minutes can already completely kill Salmonella, but still try to eat less, or buy formal edible raw eggs to make
