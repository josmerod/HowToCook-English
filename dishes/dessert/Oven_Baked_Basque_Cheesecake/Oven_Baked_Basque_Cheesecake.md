The top of the cheesecake might not be as dark as some professional photos if your oven lacks a convection fan or a top broiler function. If available, use those for better browning.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Cream Cheese: 212g (One standard block is roughly this size; original recipe calls for 250g)
- White Sugar: 60g
- 2 Eggs
- 1 Egg Yolk
- Whipping Cream: 120g
- Low-Gluten Flour (Cake flour): 10g

### Optional (Chocolate Version)

- Chocolate: 38g (Melt the chocolate and stir it into the whipping cream before mixing)

## Calculations

This recipe is sized for a **7-inch** round cake mold (the original recipe uses a 6-inch mold).

## Operation

- Soften the cream cheese (microwave for 10s + 10s).
- Cream the cheese with white sugar using a whisk/mixer until smooth.
- Add the 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk; mix well.
- Stir in the whipping cream.
- Fold in the flour until just combined.
- **Bake**: 220°C (425°F) for **20 - 25 minutes**. (20-22 minutes is usually perfect).
- Let it cool completely, then refrigerate—preferably overnight.

## Additional Content

- It is normal for the cheesecake to "jiggle" when it first comes out of the oven. It must be chilled to develop the proper flavor and texture!
