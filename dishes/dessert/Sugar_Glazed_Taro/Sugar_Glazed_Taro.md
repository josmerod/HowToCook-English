Sugar Glazed Taro is a famous Chaozhou snack and a perfect afternoon tea treat. It is very convenient to make. Estimated preparation time is **20 minutes**.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Lipu Taro (available at most Asian supermarkets—fresh and affordable)
- White Sugar or Rock Sugar
- Water
- Scallion

## Calculations

- Lipu Taro 200g
- White Sugar 30g
- Water 15g

## Operation

- Cut the taro into long strips (keep them slightly thick so they don't break during stir-frying).
- Heat enough oil in a pan to submerge the taro. Check the temperature by inserting a chopstick; it's ready when small bubbles form around it.
- Deep-fry the taro until the strips float. They should be slightly golden and you should be able to easily pierce them with a chopstick.
- Remove the taro and set aside. Don't waste the oil; it can be reused for other cooking.
- **The Critical Step**: Combine sugar (30g) and water (15g)—a 2:1 ratio. Heat until the mixture bubbles but **does not** change color.
- Add chopped scallions and the fried taro strips. **Turn off the heat** and quickly toss to coat. As the temperature drops, the sugar will crystallize into a white frosty coating (the "sand" effect).
- Plate and serve!
