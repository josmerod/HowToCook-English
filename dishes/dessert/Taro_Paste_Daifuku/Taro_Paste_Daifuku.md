## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Lipu Taro (Fresh and affordable)
- Purple Sweet Potato Powder (for color)
- Milk
- Glutinous Rice Flour
- Cornstarch
- Unsalted Butter
- Whipping Cream (e.g., Anchor)
- White Sugar
- Blender or Electric Mixer
- Sieve / Strainer
- Plastic Wrap

## Calculations

- Lipu Taro 200g
- Purple Sweet Potato Powder 3g
- Milk 165g
- Glutinous Rice Flour (A - for dusting) 50g
- Glutinous Rice Flour (B - for dough) 75g
- Cornstarch 22g
- Unsalted Butter 30g
- Whipping Cream 145g
- White Sugar 26g

## Operation

- **Taro Filling**: Cut the taro into chunks and steam or boil until soft (approx. 40 minutes). Place in a blender.
- Add 30g milk and 25g whipping cream; blend until smooth.
- Add 3g purple sweet potato powder and 18g sugar; blend again until you have a fine, vibrant taro paste.
- **The Dough**: In a bowl, combine 75g glutinous rice flour (B), 22g cornstarch, 135g milk, and 50g sugar. Mix well and strain through a sieve.
- Cover with plastic wrap, poke a few small holes, and steam over medium heat for **30 minutes**.
- **The Dusting Powder**: While the dough steams, toast the remaining 50g glutinous rice flour (A) in a dry pan over low heat until slightly yellow. Set aside as "hand powder" to prevent sticking.
- **Mixing the Dough**: Once the dough is steamed (it should be jelly-like), add 30g butter while still hot. Knead until the butter is completely absorbed and the dough is smooth. Refrigerate for **1 hour**.
- **Whipped Cream**: Whip 120g cream with 8g sugar until stiff peaks form. Place in a piping bag.
- **Assembly**: Knead the chilled dough for 5 minutes. Divide into 30g portions.
- Dust with the toasted flour. Roll each portion into a circle. Pipe 5g of whipped cream in the center, top with 30g of taro paste, and wrap it like a bun (trim any excess dough).
- Dust with more toasted flour to finish. Repeat until all ingredients are used.

## Additional Content

- It is best to wear non-stick gloves during assembly.
- Ready to serve immediately; no further heating required.
