# Oreo Ice Cream

Oreo Ice Cream is a simple yet delicious treat. Using 100% dairy cream ensures a rich flavor without being greasy. Estimated preparation time is **30 minutes** (mostly spent on whipping the cream and removing the Oreo filling).

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Whipping Cream (Animal-based cream recommended, e.g., Anchor)
- Original Oreo Cookies
- Electric Hand Mixer
- A deep container with a capacity of at least 600ml and a small diameter (ensure the mixer fits). If using ice cream molds, a container with a spout is helpful for easy pouring.
- A small knife (or a tool for removing the filling)
- Ice cream molds (Optional)

## Calculations

Per portion:

- 6 Oreo Cookies
- 18g White Sugar
- 250ml Whipping Cream

## Operation

- Twist the Oreos open and scrape off the white filling (discard or keep for other use).
- Crush the chocolate biscuits with a rolling pin or in a bag. Half should be fine powder, and the other half should have small chunks (less than 0.5cm). (Tip: You can find "Oreo Cookie Crumbs" online to save time! ^-^)
- Pour the cold cream into your deep container and add the sugar.
- Whip with the electric mixer on high speed until it forms **stiff peaks**. When you lift the mixer, the cream should hold its shape (about 0.5cm - 1cm) rather than dripping back like a liquid.
- Gently fold the Oreo crumbs into the whipped cream until evenly distributed.
- (Optional) Pour the mixture into ice cream molds.
- Place in the freezer (-18°C) for at least **4 hours** before serving.

## Additional Content

- Do not use fragile containers when crushing the cookies.
- Be careful with the knife when removing the Oreo filling.
