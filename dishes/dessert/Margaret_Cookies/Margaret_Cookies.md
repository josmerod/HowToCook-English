Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Cooked Egg Yolk
- Unsalted Butter
- White Sugar (or Powdered Sugar)
- Salt
- Low-Gluten Flour (Cake flour)
- Cornstarch
- Oven

## Calculations

Due to the high calorie content of this dessert, it's best to make small batches. One portion is perfect for one person.

Per portion:
- 1 Hard-boiled Egg Yolk
- 50g Unsalted Butter
- 20g White Sugar (30g Powdered Sugar is better if available)
- 1g Salt
- 50g Low-Gluten Flour
- 50g Cornstarch

## Operation

- Melt the butter over a water bath (or in short bursts in the microwave). Mash the hard-boiled egg yolk until fine.
- Add the sugar, salt, and mashed egg yolk to the melted butter; mix well.
- Sift in the flour and cornstarch. Knead into a smooth dough.
- Divide the dough into small balls of approximately 8g each.
- Use your thumb to gently press down on the center of each ball to create natural cracks around the edges.
- Preheat the oven to **150°C**. Bake for **20 minutes**.
- Let cool slightly before serving.

## Additional Content

- You can subtly adjust the salt and sugar ratios. For a chocolate or matcha version, replace 3g of cornstarch with cocoa or matcha powder.
- Sifting all dry ingredients (including the egg yolk) will result in a much finer texture.
- If you don't have an oven:
  - Microwave: High power for 2-3 minutes.
  - Air Fryer: 150°C for 20 minutes.
