# Chiffon Cake

Chiffon cake is an introductory baking dish with some operational difficulty. However, once successful, its fine and soft texture is uniquely rewarding. Including baking time, beginners usually take **1.5 - 2 hours** to complete.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Tools

* Oven (A rice cooker can be an alternative, but often fails due to the pot's material)
* Whisk (Electric is best; manual is exhausting and prone to failure)
* Anodized Aluminum Mold (Do **not** use non-stick molds. Standard sizes are 6-inch or 8-inch)
* Spatula (for folding the cake batter)

### Ingredients

- Eggs
- White Sugar
- Milk (or water)
- Cooking Oil (or butter, melted)
- Low-Gluten Flour (Cake flour)
- [Optional] Lemon juice or white vinegar

## Calculations

Per unit (12 area units):

- 1 Egg (medium size, approx. 50g)
- 16g White Sugar
- 8g Cooking Oil
- 10g Milk
- 17g Low-Gluten Flour

For standard molds:

* **6-inch (3 units)**: 3 Eggs, 50g Sugar, 25g Oil, 30g Milk, 50g Flour
* **8-inch (5 units)**: 5 Eggs, 80g Sugar, 40g Oil, 50g Milk, 90g Flour

## Operation

### 1. Separation

* Take fresh eggs from the refrigerator.
* Prepare two clean, dry containers for whites and yolks.
* The egg white container can have a few drops of water but **must be free of oil**. The egg yolk container must be dry.
* Separate the whites and yolks carefully.
* **Important**: No yolk should leak into the whites, or they will not whip properly. (The white chalaza/string is fine).
* Ensure the egg white container is large enough (whites should not exceed 1/8 of the volume before whipping).

### 2. Preparing the Yolk Batter

* In a new bowl, combine the oil and flour first—this prevents gluten formation.
* Add the egg yolks, milk, and **1/4** of the total sugar. Mix well with a spatula.
* Continue adding flour gradually while mixing in a "Z-motion" (Z-shape). **Do not** stir in a circular motion.
* Mix until smooth and free of dry powder (a few small lumps are acceptable).
* Set aside.

### 3. Whipping the Egg Whites (Meringue)

* Prepare the remaining **3/4** of the sugar.
* (Optional) Add lemon juice or vinegar to the whites.
* **Medium speed**: Whip until large, coarse bubbles form. Add **1/4** of total sugar.
* **High speed**: Whip until bubbles are fine and dense. Add **1/4** of total sugar.
* **High speed**: Whip until "soft peaks" form (the tip curls when the whisk is lifted). Add the last **1/4** of sugar.
* **Low-medium speed**: Whip until "stiff peaks" form (the tip stands straight up; the container can be turned upside down without the whites falling out).
* Ensure you whip all the way to the bottom of the bowl.

### 4. Mixing the Batter

* Stir the yolk mixture briefly.
* Gently fold **1/3** of the meringue into the yolk mixture.
* **Folding Technique**: Use a spatula to cut through the center, scrape the bottom, and lift over the top (like stir-frying). Do not stir circles.
* Pour the yolk mixture back into the remaining **2/3** of meringue. Fold gently until uniform.
* Pour the batter into the mold. Tap the mold on a counter a few times to release large air bubbles.

### 5. Baking

* Total time: **30-35 mins** (6-inch) or **50 mins** (8-inch). Adjust based on your oven.
* Preheat to **150°C (Top)** and **160°C (Bottom)**.
* Phase 1 (First 3/5 of time): **150°C Top / 160°C Bottom**.
* Phase 2 (Remaining 2/5 of time): Increase to **160°C Top / 170°C Bottom**.
* Carefully remove from the oven when done (use oven mitts).

### 6. Cooling and De-molding

* (Optional) Drop the mold once from a height of ~10cm to release hot air.
* **Invert the mold** and let cool for at least 10 minutes.
* Do not de-mold while hot, or the cake will collapse.
* De-mold and enjoy!

- Crucial factor: Baking **temperature and time** are more important than just whipping.
- Why water is okay in whites but oil isn't: Whites are 85% water. Oil breaks the bubble structure.
