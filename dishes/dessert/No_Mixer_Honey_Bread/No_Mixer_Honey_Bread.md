# No-Mixer Honey Bread

![Finished Honey Bread](./无厨师机蜂蜜面包.jpg)

This recipe doesn't require a stand mixer—only patience! You can prepare the dough in the evening, let it proof in the fridge overnight, and bake it the next day. While the texture isn't quite as airy as mixer-kneaded bread, it's still great—especially when reheated in the microwave for a few seconds. Most of the time is spent waiting for the dough to rise.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Dough

- Bread Flour (High-gluten): 400g
- Milk: 200g
- Yeast: 4g
- 1 Egg
- White Sugar: 70g
- Salt: 2g
- Butter: 30g

### Honey Glaze (for the top)
- Honey: 20g
- Water: 20g

### Optional
- Sesame seeds (for topping)

## Calculations

This recipe makes enough to fill one large rectangular baking pan (10 x 15 inch / 25 x 38 cm) plus one square pan (9 x 9 inch / 23 x 23 cm). Use parchment paper. Scale down if needed. This amount provides breakfast for about two weeks; the bread will harden in the fridge, so microwave for 10-20 seconds before eating.

## Operation

- **Mixing**: Combine the flour, milk (heated to ~40°C, about 15-20s in microwave), yeast, egg, sugar, and salt.
- Mix until a cohesive dough forms.
- Incorporate the butter and knead by hand until evenly distributed.
- **First Proof**: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let it sit at room temperature (10-20°C) for 1-2 hours. Longer is fine.
- Once the dough has doubled in size and is no longer very sticky, start dividing.
- **Division**: Divide into portions of ~60g each for an aesthetic look.
- **Shaping**: Roll each portion into a long tongue shape with a rolling pin, then roll it up like a cigar. Let rest for 10 minutes.
- **Secondary Shaping**: Repeat the rolling and cigar-shaping. Cut each roll in half (one becomes two).
- (Optional) Repeat the roll-and-shape process a few more times if you have time for more layers.
- **Baking Prep**: Line the pans with parchment paper and grease with a little peanut oil. Dip the bottom of each piece in water, then flour, and place in the pan.
- **Final Proof**: Cover with plastic wrap and let rise again. (This can be done overnight in the fridge).
- Brush the tops with egg wash.
- **Bake**: 180°C (355°F) for **18 - 20 minutes**.
- Once out of the oven, brush with honey water and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

## Additional Content

- Proofing time varies; check every hour. It should be 2 to 2.5 times its original size.
- Dough size won't drastically affect flavor—adjust to your preference.
