## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Tools
* Oven
* Electric Mixer
* Metal cake mold (any shape)
* Parchment paper
* Spatula or knife (for folding and smoothing)
* Oven mitts
* [Optional] Egg separator

### Ingredients
* Eggs
* Erythritol (or another low-calorie sweetener)
* Cocoa powder
* Konjac powder
* Cream of Tartar (or lemon juice)

## Calculations

Per portion (approx. 9.25 x 5 x 1 inch):
* 3 Eggs
* Erythritol 50g
* Cocoa powder 10g
* Konjac powder 10g
* Cream of Tartar 1g

## Operation

### 1. Preheat
* Start by preheating your oven to **150°C (350°F)**.

### 2. Separation
* Use clean, dry bowls. Separate the egg whites and yolks. 
* **Important**: Ensure the egg white bowl is strictly oil-free. Even a tiny amount of yolk or oil will prevent the whites from whipping.

### 3. Whipping the Whites
* Add the cream of tartar to the whites.
* Whip on high speed until large bubbles form. Add the erythritol.
* Continue whipping on medium-low speed until **stiff peaks** form (the foam stands upright when the whisk is lifted, and doesn't fall out when the bowl is inverted).

### 4. Mixing
* Add the yolks to the whipped whites and mix briefly on low speed.
* Sift the cocoa powder and konjac powder over the mixture. Use a spatula to gently fold them in (do not use the mixer yet to avoid a "dust cloud").
* **Folding Technique**: Scrape the bottom and fold over from the edges. Do not stir in circles.
* Once combined, give it a quick mix with the electric mixer on low to ensure no lumps remain.

### 5. Baking
* Line your mold with parchment paper.
* Pour the batter into the mold and smooth the top. Tap it gently on the counter to release large air bubbles.
* **Bake for 25 minutes**.
* Carefully remove from the oven with mitts.

### 6. Cooling
* Let the cake cool in the mold for about 10 minutes before removing it. 
* Once cool, slice and serve.
