## Essential Ingredients and Tools

This recipe provides enough filling for a full pack of store-bought tart shells.

- Egg tart shells (Any brand)
- Eggs
- Milk
- Whipping Cream
- White Sugar
- Oven
- Kitchen scale
- Whisk or chopsticks
- Sieve / Strainer (approx. 1mm mesh)

## Calculations

Filling for one full pack (approx. 30 shells):

- Egg tart shells (approx. 30 pieces)
- 8 Eggs
- 200ml Milk
- 450ml Whipping Cream
- 80g White Sugar (Use fine sugar for easier dissolving. Range: 60-100g to taste)

## Operation

- Place a bowl on the scale and weigh out 450g of whipping cream (assume density of 1).
- Add 80g white sugar.
- Add 200g milk (assume density of 1).
- Separate 8 egg yolks and add them to the bowl (save the egg whites for another dish).
- Whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved.
- Strain the mixture through a sieve to remove membranes, eggshells, or undissolved sugar. This ensures a smooth filling.
- **Preheat** the oven to 220°C (approx. 10 minutes).
- Space the tart shells evenly on a baking tray (~0.5cm apart).
- Fill each shell with the mixture until about 0.5cm from the top edge. Do not overfill.
- (Optional) You can freeze the unbaked tarts at this stage for 12+ hours to use later.
- **Bake** at 200°C for **25 minutes**.
- Serve hot.
