Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- 25g Guilinggao (Tortoise Jelly) Powder
- 120ml Cold Water
- 500ml Boiling Water
- 100g White Sugar
- Small Pot
- Stirring tool
- Molds or small bowls

## Calculations

One batch makes approximately 3-4 small bowls, suitable for 2-4 people.

## Operation

1. In a pot, combine 25g Guilinggao powder with 120ml cold water. Stir thoroughly until no lumps remain.
2. In a separate container, dissolve 100g sugar in 500ml boiling water.
3. Slowly pour the hot sugar water into the Guilinggao mixture, stirring constantly to prevent clumping.
4. Place the pot over medium-low heat. Stir continuously as the mixture heats to prevent sticking.
5. Once the liquid thickens and begins to bubble slightly, remove from heat.
6. Quickly pour the liquid into molds and let cool naturally. Refrigerate for **1-2 hours** for the best texture and flavor.

## Additional Content

- Do not move the containers while the jelly is cooling, as this can affect the setting process.
- Avoid using high heat, which can cause the mixture to scorch or form lumps.
- Serve with honey, condensed milk, or fresh fruit for added flavor.
- Concentration may vary by brand; adjust ratios according to the packaging if necessary.
