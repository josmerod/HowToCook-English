Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Unsalted Butter (e.g., President)
- Low-Gluten Flour (Cake flour)
- Sugar
- Salt
- Baking Powder
- 1 Egg
- Whipping Cream
- Cream Cheese (Optional)

## Calculations

One batch serves 4-6 people.

Per portion:
- Unsalted Butter 40g
- Low-Gluten Flour 180g
- Sugar 30g
- Salt 1g
- Baking Powder 5g
- 1 Egg (approx. 50g)
- Whipping Cream 45g
- Cream Cheese 50g

## Operation

- Beat the egg. Reserve 20g for brushing. Combine the remaining 30g of egg with the whipping cream and cream cheese in a clean bowl. (If the cheese is too hard, warm it over a water bath to ~40°C before mixing).
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder.
- Cut the cold butter into small cubes. Add to the flour mixture and rub in with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.
- Pour the egg/cream mixture into the flour/butter mixture. Stir until just combined, then gently press into a uniform dough. Do not overwork.
- Place the dough on a floured surface and roll it out to a thickness of **1.5cm**. Cut into desired shapes using a knife or a cookie cutter.
- Brush the tops with the reserved egg wash.
- **Bake**: Preheat oven to **180°C** and bake for **27 minutes**.

## Additional Content

- The simplest cutting method is to roll the dough into a circle and cut it into 6 wedges (like a pizza).
