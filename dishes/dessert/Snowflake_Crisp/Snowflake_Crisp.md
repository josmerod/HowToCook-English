## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Tools
- Non-stick pan
- Silicone spatula (Avoid metal to protect the pan coating)
- Disposable gloves
- Snowflake Crisp / Nougat mold
- Rolling pin

### Ingredients
- Unsalted Butter
- Marshmallows
- Full-Cream Milk Powder
- Mixed Nuts
- Biscuits (Plain/Cracker type, e.g., Ritz or specialized baking biscuits)

## Calculations

Per portion:
- Unsalted Butter 20g
- Marshmallows 75g
- Full-Cream Milk Powder 40g (plus extra for dusting)
- Mixed Nuts 60g
- Biscuits 75g

## Operation

- Break the biscuits into pieces roughly the size of a coin.
- Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over low heat until completely liquid.
- Add the marshmallows and stir with a spatula until fully melted and combined with the butter.
- Add 20g of the milk powder. Stir until just combined, then **immediately turn off the heat**.
- Quickly add the nuts and biscuits to the warm mixture and fold together with the spatula.
- Once the mixture is cool enough to handle, wear gloves and knead/stretch the mixture to ensure the marshmallow-butter base is evenly distributed around the biscuits and nuts.
- Press the mixture firmly into your mold. Use a rolling pin to flatten the top and ensure a tight pack.
- Let it cool to room temperature. Once set, remove from the mold and cut into squares.
- Dust the squares with the remaining milk powder until all sides are coated.
