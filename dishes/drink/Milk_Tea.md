## Calculations

Per portion:

- 2 Tea Bags (approx. 4g)
- 11-12g Milk Powder
- 5-7g Sugar

## Operation

- Put 2 tea bags into the cup and add 180-200ml of **boiling water**.

- Weigh out 11-12g of milk powder and 5-7g of sugar. Add them separately to the tea liquid obtained in the previous step.

## Additional Content

- After adding boiling water, try to keep the cup warm by using a cup with a small opening or covering it with a lid. If the ambient temperature is low, using a measuring cup might cool the water before it's poured; in this case, you can skip the measuring cup and estimate the volume.
- After the waiting time, you can lift or stir the tea bags to ensure an even brew.
