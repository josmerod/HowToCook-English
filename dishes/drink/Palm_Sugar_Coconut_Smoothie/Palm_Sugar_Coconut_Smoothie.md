The Palm Sugar Coconut Smoothie is an extremely fast and convenient drink to make. If the ingredients are chosen correctly, it offers a rich texture. It makes some noise during preparation, so it's best made during the day as an afternoon tea.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Bottled Coconut Milk/Juice (a wide-mouth bottle is better)
- Coffee Sugar (Yellow coarse granules/demerara)

## Calculations

The best portion size for a smoothie is usually related to how fast it melts. 300g of smoothie frozen at -18°C will typically last about 30 minutes at room temperature.

Per portion:

- Bottled Coconut Milk 500ml
- Coffee Sugar 10g (e.g., two packets of Taikoo Coffee Sugar)
- Crushed Nuts (Optional)

## Operation

- Pour out 200ml from a 500ml bottle of coconut milk, then tighten the cap immediately.
- Place the bottle in the freezer for at least 10 hours.
- Remove the bottle. Once you're sure the coconut milk is completely frozen, "strike" or hit the bottle against a hard surface like a wall corner, chair back, or table corner. (Ensure the surface won't be damaged).
- Once the frozen coconut milk turns into a smoothie consistency, open the cap and pour it out.
- Sprinkle coffee sugar or crushed nuts evenly over the surface.
- Done.

## Additional Content

- Bottled coconut milk can be frozen in advance, but it should not be stored for more than 7 days as it may spoil.
