## Operation

- **Jasmine Green Tea Preparation** (Recommended ratio => Tea : Water : Ice = 1-2 : 50 : 30):
  - Place 2-4g of tea leaves in a container, add 100ml boiling water, and steep for 6 minutes.
  - Add 60g ice cubes to the steeped tea to cool it; stir to accelerate cooling.
  - Once the ice has melted, filter out the leaves to obtain about 160ml of jasmine tea liquid.
- **Final Mixing**:
  - Choose a clear glass (approx. 300ml).
  - Peel the mandarins and remove the membranes to get the segments of pulp.
  - Place 130g of pulp and 130ml of jasmine green tea into the blender.
  - Add 10g sugar syrup (Optional, if you prefer it sweeter).
  - Cover and blend for 20 seconds, then pour the mixture into the glass.
  - Shred a little extra pulp and sprinkle it on the surface.

Enjoy!
