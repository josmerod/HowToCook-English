# B52 Bomber

B-52 is a cocktail with a unique drinking method, usually served with a short straw, napkins, and a lighter.

The drink is ignited and then quickly consumed through a straw, providing a sensation of transitioning from cold to hot—a true "ice and fire" experience that can only be understood by trying it.

While a straw is suitable for most, the most thrilling way is to drink it in one shot. When doing so, avoid touching the rim of the glass to prevent burns and let the fire extinguish in your mouth to get the best flavor.

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Kahlúa Coffee Liqueur
- Baileys Irish Cream
- Skyy Original Vodka
- Bar Spoon
- Liqueur Glass
- Lighter

## Calculations

Per portion:

- Kahlúa 10ml
- Baileys 10ml
- Skyy Vodka 10ml

## Operation

- Pour Kahlúa into the bottom 1/3 of the liqueur glass (10ml).
- Slowly pour Baileys over the back of a bar spoon to fill the middle 1/3 (10ml). Note: Pour slowly to ensure distinct layers; pouring too fast will mix it with the coffee liqueur.
- Finally, pour Skyy Vodka onto the top layer (10ml).
- Lightly warm the rim of the glass with a lighter.
- The final step is ignition: Do you see the faint blue flame?

## Additional Content

- A common way to drink it in bars is to provide a straw, insert it while the flame is still burning, and quickly inhale the entire contents.
- Do not worry about the fire; since the straw is thin and oxygen is limited, the flame will extinguish. You will feel a wave of heat down your throat into your stomach, followed by a long-lasting aftertaste of coffee and cream. It is very stimulating and delicious.
