## Essential Ingredients and Tools

Ingredients:

- Bourbon Whiskey
- Coca-Cola
- Ice Cubes
- Lemon (Optional, for flavor enhancement)

Tools:

- Manual Juicer/Squeezer

## Calculations

For one portion, about 900ml (including ice):

- Whiskey 100ml
- Coca-Cola 500ml
- 1 Lemon
- Ice Cubes 300g

## Operation

### Lemon Preparation

1. Cut the lemon in half (**perpendicular to the axis connecting the ends**), and cut one thin slice from one half for garnish.
2. Cut the rest of the lemon into quarters and use a juicer to extract the juice into a container.
3. Keep the squeezed lemon wedges for later.

### Mixing

1. Choose a large glass (about 1 liter) or a tin bucket.
2. Place the ice cubes and squeezed lemon wedges into the glass (arrange them however you like).
3. Pour in 15ml of lemon juice (add more if you like it sour).
4. Slowly pour Coca-Cola along the side of the glass until it is 3/4 full (the ratio of cola to whiskey should be about 5:1).
5. Add whiskey until the glass is full.

## Additional Content

The "Cola Bucket" masks the taste of whiskey with ice and cola, which can lead people—especially those with low alcohol tolerance—to consume excessive amounts without realizing it. Please mix and consume responsibly.
