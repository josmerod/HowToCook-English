- Rum (Optional)

## Calculations

Each portion serves 1 person.

Per portion:

- Ice Cubes 50g
- Soda Water 30ml
- Cream 30ml
- Milk 10ml
- Sugar 8g
- Sea Salt 0.5g
- Rum 5ml

## Operation

- Whip the cream with sugar until soft peaks form, then add rum and milk and stir until it reaches a pourable "flowy" consistency.
- Pour the cream over the top of the mixed liquid.
- Sprinkle sea salt on top of the cream.

## Additional Content

- For coffee liquid, fruity/floral beans are recommended. For espresso, choose medium roast; for cold brew, washed or natural process beans work well.
- When pouring the cream, keep the height as low as possible so the cream floats evenly on the surface to form a "milk cap."
- Using fresh coffee and pineapple juice will greatly improve the overall flavor.
