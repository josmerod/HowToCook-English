  - Place 3-6g of tea leaves in a container, add 150ml boiling water, and steep for 6 minutes.
  - Add 90g ice cubes to the steeped tea to cool it down; stir to accelerate cooling.
  - Once the ice has melted, filter out the leaves to obtain about 240ml of jasmine tea liquid.
- **Orange Preparation** (Can be done while the tea steeps):
  - Cut the orange in half (**perpendicular to the axis connecting the ends**) and cut one slice from one half for garnish.
  - Cut the rest into quarters and use a juicer to extract the juice.

  - Choose a clear glass (350-400ml).
  - Place 70g of ice at the bottom and pour in all the orange juice.
  - Place the orange slice against the inner wall of the glass.
  - Pour one portion of the marinated passion fruit over the ice.
  - Slowly pour the jasmine green tea (or soda water) into the glass to maintain layers.
