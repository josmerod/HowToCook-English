# Fermented Rice Wine (Laocao / Jiuniang)

![Finished Jiuniang](./酒酿醪糟.jpeg)

Jiuniang, also known as Laocao, is a traditional Chinese fermented sweet dish. The finished product is sweet and slightly boozy (low alcohol content). It has the effect of strengthening the spleen and promoting digestion. Although it requires some fermentation skill, the process is simple and rewarding—a great choice for beginners in fermentation. Estimated active preparation time is 1 hour (plus 2 days of fermentation).

Estimated Cooking Difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Glutinous Rice 800g (Round-grain glutinous rice is recommended)
- Angel Brand Sweet Rice Leaven (Koji) 1 pack (8g). (Although the ratio is 3g per 1000g of rice, using more increases the success rate).
- Water 720g + 600g (720g for steaming rice, 600g for fermentation)
- Steamer (or a rice cooker)
- Thermometer (Optional but recommended)
- 1 Clean, airtight glass or ceramic container

## Calculations

This recipe serves 6-8 people.

## Operation

- Rinse 800g of glutinous rice and place it in the rice cooker. Add 720g of water and use the standard "cook rice" mode.
- Once cooked, spread the rice out on a clean surface to cool to about 30°C. (Measure with a thermometer; it should feel warm but not hot to the touch).
- Dissolve 8g of Angel Yeast in 20ml of warm water (approx. 30°C), sprinkle it evenly over the rice, and mix well.
- Add 600g of water to the rice and mix again. Wait 2-3 minutes for the rice to absorb the water. This initial addition ensures a juicy result.
- Use a clean tool to make a small hole in the center of the rice (to monitor liquid level).
- Transfer the mixture into a clean container, press the surface lightly, and seal with a lid or plastic wrap.
- Place in an environment between 28-32°C for 24-48 hours. Do not shake or move the container during fermentation.
- **Success Criteria**: Clear liquid seeps into the center hole, the mixture has a pleasant boozy aroma, and there are no off-white molds or sour smells.
- Refrigerate immediately once fermentation is complete (you can add dried osmanthus flowers at this stage). Use clean tools to serve. It can be stored for 7-10 days.

- To increase yield, you can perform a second fermentation by adding 500ml water (up to 800ml total).
- Fermentation continues over time. To stop it, steam the mixture for 10 minutes or keep it refrigerated.

### Advanced Version 1: Soaking Method

- Rinse 800g of glutinous rice and soak in water for 6-8 hours (8-10 hours in winter) until the grains are plump.
- Drain and steam the rice over water for 40-60 minutes. Stir every 20 minutes to ensure even cooking.
- Cool the rice and proceed with the yeast as above.

### Advanced Version 2: Mixed Grains

- Experienced makers can substitute up to 20% of the glutinous rice with millet, oats, yellow rice, or black glutinous rice.

## Additional Content

- Fermentation temperature is critical: too low and it will be slow or fail; too high and the yeast will die.
- Common failure causes: high temperature, mixing yeast when rice is too hot, or contamination with oil or water.
- Can be served warm with tangyuan (rice balls), egg drops, or goji berries. Avoid boiling for too long to preserve the aroma.
- The liquid can also be used for making rice cakes or as a flavoring for dishes like gyudon or teriyaki.
