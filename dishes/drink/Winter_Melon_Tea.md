## Calculations

Determine how many portions you plan to make. One portion is enough for 4-5 people.

Per portion:

- Winter Melon 1000g
- Rock Sugar 300g

## Operation

1. **Prepare the Winter Melon**: Peel and de-seed the winter melon, then cut it into small pieces (each no larger than 4cm).
2. **Add Rock Sugar**: Mix the winter melon with rock sugar, stir well, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
3. **Cook**: By this time, the winter melon will have released a lot of juice. Pour everything into a pot, bring to a boil over high heat, then turn to medium-low heat and simmer slowly for 1-2 hours. Stir frequently to prevent burning.
4. **Filter**: Use a sieve to filter the cooked tea liquid, removing the winter melon chunks and keeping only the liquid.
5. **Cool**: Let the winter melon tea liquid cool, then pour it into a clean container and refrigerate.
6. **Enjoy**: The brewed winter melon tea is a concentrate. Add water or other drinks according to your preference. It can be served hot or cold.
