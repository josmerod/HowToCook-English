## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Hawthorn Slices (Dried, raw)
- Yellow Rock Sugar
- Licorice Root (Gancao)
- Dried Tangerine Peel (Chenpi)
- Red Cardamom (Hong Dou Kou)
- Dried Osmanthus Flowers

## Calculations

- 2 liters of Water
- Smoked Jujube 25g
- Smoked Plum 25g
- Yellow Rock Sugar 100g
- Hawthorn Slices 30g
- Licorice Root 2g
- Dried Tangerine Peel 4g
- Red Cardamom 1g
- Dried Osmanthus 3g

All portions can be increased or decreased proportionally.

## Operation

- Rinse all ingredients (except dried osmanthus and rock sugar). Soak them in 1.5 liters of room temperature water for at least two hours.
- Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, cover, and simmer over low heat for 40 minutes. This is the "First Decoction."
- Place rock sugar in a basin, then pour the hot "First Decoction" liquid through a filter into the basin. Stir until the sugar dissolves.
- Return the ingredients to the pot with another 600ml of water. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over medium heat for another 20 minutes. This is the "Second Decoction."
- Mix the "Second Decoction" with the sugar-sweetened first batch while both are hot. When the mixture cools to 60-70°C (do not exceed 80°C), add the dried osmanthus. Cover and let it cool completely, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
- Strain out the osmanthus flowers before drinking. Sip slowly to enjoy the refreshing tartness and balanced sweetness with a long-lasting aftertaste.
